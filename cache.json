I did a presentation with my friend and hero James Ward on Spring and Kotlin (that was voted third most-liked talk at a show with more than 250 speakers!) That was a personal career highlight for me - it’s not often you get to win and have fun in life. And, as if that wasn’t awesome enough, this week I am in Las Vegas, NV, for JavaOne! Fingers crossed, this week will go smoothly, too! Both Devoxx and JavaOne are the first such shows since at least before the pandemic. It’s been a very long time in coming and I’m elated, overjoyed, to be able to be here.\n\r\nAnd, of course, I’m super excited about SpringOne 2022! Also, the first in-person show of its kind since before the pandemic! It’s going to be amazing. Have you registered?

Based on the new Micrometer Observation work, this infrastructure replaces the former GraphQL Metrics support in Spring Boot 2.7. GraphQL is a good use case for Observability in general, as the GraphQL engine can distribute the data fetching operations over caches, databases, REST APIs and more. It’s important not only to keep track of performance metrics for your GraphQL API, but also to be able to explore traces and investigate production issues.\n\r\nWe didn’t have time to tackle features like Pagination/Relay or AOT/Native support, but we’re listening to the community.

These are brand new generations of the framework, implying huge new paradigms and new opportunities for developers. \n\r\nThis first is a broader, whirlwind tour of the new features in Spring Framework 6 (which bubble up into Spring Boot 3).\n\r\n\r\nThis second one introduces the new ahead-of-time (AOT) support in Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, which makes it trivial to build GraalVM native images.\n\r\n\n\r\nNB: please ignore the metadata for the YouTube videos. Both talks feature both speakers, and there is no mention whatsoever of React and JavaScript and the like. I think that was a metadata issue with the publication of the videos on YouTube, which will hopefully be resolved. \n\r\nEnjoy!",

          "description": "On behalf of the team and all contributors, I am pleased to announce that Spring Batch 5.0.0-M8 is now available from our milestone repository.\n\r\nIn this milestone, we introduced two main changes:\n\r\n\r\n  \nNew default execution context serialization format\n\r\n  \nSystemCommandTasklet enhancements\n\r\n\r\nThis blog post walks through these two major changes in details. For the complete list of changes,\nplease check the release notes.\nNew default execution context serialization format\n\r\nIn this milestone release, the DefaultExecutionContextSerializer was updated to serialize/deserialize the context to/from Base64.\n\r\nMoreover, the default ExecutionContextSerializer configured by @EnableBatchProcessing or DefaultBatchConfiguration was changed from JacksonExecutionContextStringSerializer to DefaultExecutionContextSerializer. The dependency to Jackson was made optional. In order to use the JacksonExecutionContextStringSerializer, jackson-core should be added to the classpath.\nSystemCommandTasklet enhancements\n\r\nThe SystemCommandTasklet has been revisited in this release and was changed as follows:\n\r\n\r\n  \n\r\n  \nA new strategy interface named CommandRunner was introduced in order to decouple the command execution from the tasklet execution. The default implementation is the JvmCommandRunner which uses the java.lang.Runtime#exec API to run system commands. This interface can be implemented to use any other API to run system commands.\n\r\n  \n\r\n  \nThe method that runs the command now accepts an array of Strings representing the command and its arguments. There is no need to tokenize the command or do any pre-processing anymore. This change makes the API more intuitive, and less prone to errors.\n\r\n\nFeedback\n\r\nI would like to thank all contributors who had a role in this release!

We believe that the interconnection between metrics, logging, and distributed tracing gives you the ability to reason about the state of your system in order to debug exceptions and latency in your applications.

It’s architecting for agility. It’s production.

This version will be shipped with Spring Boot 3.0.0-M5 due for release later this week.\n\r\nSpring Boot 3.0 is around the corner and the community is expecting a compatible Spring for GraphQL version to go with it. Currently, the best way to prepare for the Spring Boot 3.0 upgrade is to upgrade to Spring Boot 2.7 and Java 17, but Spring Boot 3.0 has new baseline requirements, namely Java 17, Jakarta APIs and Spring Framework 6.0.\n\r\nGiven that Spring for GraphQL 1.0.0 was released towards the end of May this year, we didn’t feel we would have enough time nor feedback to go with a major release of the project for Boot 3.0. This is why the goal of the 1.1 release is simply to adapt to the new baseline requirements and provide a smooth upgrade to Spring Boot 3.0 for existing projects.\n\r\nThis first milestone brings those foundational changes: the Java 17, Jakarta APIs, and a Spring Framework 6.0 baseline. We’re also taking the opportunity to upgrade to GraphQL Java 19.x – a painless upgrade on our side, thanks to the GraphQL Java team! We’ve also replaced our internally developed context propagation mechanism with the new Micrometer Context Propagation library, that’s intended for use broadly across Spring projects. It allows Spring applications to propagate context across various such mechanisms, e.g. ThreadLocal, Reactor Context, GraphQLContext, and others.\n\r\nIn the next milestones, we will consider how we can adapt our current arrangement with important themes in Spring Boot 3.0: GraalVM native image and Micrometer Observability support. Given the short timeline, we might schedule some changes for a future version – again, a smooth upgrade is our top priority here.\nHow can you help?\n\r\nIf you have general questions, please ask on stackoverflow.com using the spring-graphql tag.\n\r\nProject Page | GitHub | Issues | Documentation | Stack Overflow",

Before we get started, let’s go over how Spring Cloud Gateway works:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n  \nFirst, a client makes a network request to the Gateway\n\r\n  \nThe Gateway is defined with a number of routes, each with Predicates to match the request to the route. For example, you can match on the path segment of the URL or the HTTP method of the request.\n\r\n  \nOnce matched, the Gateway executes pre-request logic on each of the filters applied to the route. For example, you might want to add query parameters to your request\n\r\n  \nA proxy filter routes the request to the proxied service\n\r\n  \nThe service executes and returns a response\n\r\n  \nThe gateway receives the response and executes post-request logic on each filter before return…",

          "description": "It has been almost 4 years since the last set of Spring Web Flow releases. Nevertheless, the project continues to serve a specific need particularly well, arguably better than alternatives, and remains in active use. While there hasn’t been a strong driver for new releases, the upcoming Spring Framework 6 brings a Java 17 baseline and makes the shift to Jakarta EE, which creates the need for such a release in order to enable applications to migrate to this new baseline.\n\r\nToday I’m pleased to announce the availability of Spring Web Flow 3.0 M1 in the Spring milestone repository. This release focuses mainly on compatibility with Spring Framework 6 and Jakarta EE. The Travel booking-mvc sample on spring-projects/spring-webflow-samples has been updated and the commit history provides example changes. One significant change is the need to remove Tiles which has not migrated to Jakarta EE. In the sample, Thymeleaf Layouts is used instead.\n\r\nNote that Spring Faces is not included in the release due to its deep integration with JSF and the additional time and effort required to migrate. Please, reach out if you have experience with Web Flow and JSF and are interested to help out with the migration of Spring Faces to Spring Framework 6 and Jakarta EE.\n\r\nIf you have a Web Flow application and you plan to migrate to Spring Framework 6, please give this milestone a try and provide feedback through the project issue tracker. Special thanks to Ian Young and Scott Cantor for their substantial contributions to this release!",

This week I’m writing you from sunny Seattle, Washington, where we’re having our next installment of the SpringOne Tour series. It’s been a ton of fun seeing all these fun and friendly faces again and getting to see people, many of whom I haven’t seen since before the pandemic! I’ve also had a lot of fun seeing some friends from some of the big cloud companies here, Microsoft and AWS. It’s always interesting to learn how people are using the latest and greatest from Spring to build amazing systems and software targeting these cloud platforms.\n\r\nWe’ve got a lot to cover this week so let’s dive right into it!\n\r\n\r\n  \nIn last week’s podcast, I talked to Kubernetes contributor and fellow Tanzu Developer Advocate Leigh Capili\n\r\n  \nDistributed Tracing With OpenTelemetry, Spring Cloud Sleuth, Kafka, and Jaeger\n\r\n  \nIngress vs. Load Balancer in Kubernetes\n\r\n  \nInstantiating Multiple Beans of the Same Class with Spring Annotations\n\r\n  \nCurious about when and why to use Java 14 Records vs. Lombok? Check out this article\n\r\n  \nI put together this little example , thanks to Reactor lead Simon Baslé, showing how to handle pagination with the expand operator in Project Reactor: Pagination in a Reactive Application. It looks at how to eleganrly expand the contents of a reactive stream as new data (in a data pagination scenario) becomes available.\n\r\n  \nSpring Shell 2.1.0-RC1 is now available\n\r\n  \nPushing a Docker Image to a Self-Hosted Registry\n\r\n  \nSpring for Apache Kafka 2.9 Release Candidate Available\n\r\n  \nThis Apache Maven Survival Guide is quite interesting, to me at least!",

Now, I’m back in beautiful San Francisco. Today the weather will climb to a monumental 84 F! That’s very unusual, for any time of the year, here in San Francisco. Most places here in San Francisco don’t have air conditioning. Some have heating. I bought a brand new condo in 2014 and it didn’t have air conditioning. You just open the window. I am privileged enough that I have air conditioning today, of course. I mention all this to say that it’s hot here! I worry for the elderly! When it gets this hot, the YMCA and other organizations typically invite elderly people to come in and get some cool air and water. It’s dangerous. Some days it gets even hotter. Very rare, but it does happen. I hope you’re all doing well. Take care of yourselves and each other, my friends. \n\r\nAnd, speaking of being hot, let’s look at this week’s roundup of the latest-and-greatest that’s hot off the press! \n\r\n\r\n  \nBootiful Podcast: Spring Framework contributor Sébastien Deleuze on GraalVM, AOT, project Leyden, and WebAssembly\n\r\n  \nCVE report published for Spring Cloud Function\n\r\n  \nDebugging Collections, Streams and Watch Renderers\n\r\n  \nDifference Between Flux.create and Flux.generate\n\r\n  \nHandle Spring Security Exceptions With @ExceptionHandler\n\r\n  \nMongoDB Composite Key With Spring Data\n\r\n  \nSpring Authorization Server 0.3.1 available now\n\r\n  \nMonitoring Spring Boot applications using Spring Boot Admin\n\r\n  \nSpring Data 2021.2.1 and 2021.1.5 released\n\r\n  \nSpring Data JPA – Run an App Without a Database\n\r\n  \nSpring Data MongoDB SpEL Expression Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2022-22980)\n\r\n  \nSpring Framework 5.3.21 available now\n\r\n  \nSpring Security 5.7.2 and 5.6.6 available now\n\r\n  \nSpring Tools 4.15.0 released\n\r\n  \nSpring Tools 4.15.1 released\n\r\n  \nWhat are the Spring Boot Default Memory Settings?\n\r\n  \nA Guide to Docker Private Registry\n\r\n  \nIs There a Destructor in Java?",

Toolkit's components help you retrieve relevant data from Microsoft 365 and show it in your app in any way you want. And with toolkit's authentication providers, setting up auth is a matter of adding a few lines of code. Never again fiddle with setting up a login, handling access tokens, building web requests, and dealing with errors.\n \nLearn Microsoft Graph Toolkit interactively\nTo help you learn what Microsoft Graph Toolkit has to offer and how you'd use it in your app, we recently released a new learning path on Microsoft Learn. By following a few learn modules you'll learn everything that you need to know to use the toolkit in your app. But that's not all.\nThinking about the different ways in which people learn, we've launched an experiment - an interactive code tour that you can follow to add Microsoft Graph Toolkit to a React app.\n\n \n\n \nBy following the instructions in the tour, you gradually extend an empty React app with Microsoft Graph Toolkit turning it into a true Microsoft 365 app. What's cool about this code tour, is that it puts the code of your app in the center. Rather than reading long-form, you're in the code and get relevant, and in-place tips for building your app.\n \nThe Microsoft Graph Toolkit React code tour is a great way to quickly experience how you'd use the toolkit in a React app. We'd love it if you gave it a try and told us what you think. Shall we consider building tours for other technologies and scenarios?\n \nTry the Microsoft Graph Toolkit React code tour",

          "description": "If you're a web developer, there's an exciting opportunity for you to build applications for Microsoft 365, which many organizations across the world use for work. Let me show you, how you can use your existing skills and build your first application that integrates with Microsoft 365 in just 10 minutes.\n \nWhat's Microsoft 365?\nMicrosoft 365 is a set of applications, like Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Word, or SharePoint, that organizations use for work. Every day, millions of people use Microsoft 365 to chat, meet, send emails, create documents, and more.\n \nBut Microsoft 365 isn't just a set of apps. It's also a platform that enables developers, like yourself, to build applications. These apps can tap into data and insights stored on Microsoft 365 and bring them into people's workflows.\n \nBuilding for a platform\nBuilding for a platform isn't trivial. It comes with all kinds of specific knowledge you have to have like what tooling, SDKs, and APIs to use, how to integrate your app, and finally how to package and distribute it. What many people forget though, is that you don't have to learn everything about everything at once. Often, you can start simple and build up from there.\n \nBuild your first Microsoft 365 app in just 10 minutes\nRecently, I published an article on freeCodeCamp that shows you how you can build your first Microsoft 365 app in just 10 minutes.\n\n \n\n \nSure, the app is simple and doesn't do much, but when building it, you'll learn the fundamental concepts of building apps on Microsoft 365. And after these 10 minutes, you'll have a functional app that works and retrieves data from Microsoft 365, and which you can use as a starting point for more complex apps.\n \nGive it a try, and we're looking forward to hearing what you think.",

This is a tool that clearly outlines tasks and to which teams they have been assigned to. This helps you to manage the whole project in an efficient manner by taking note of the projection timeline. You get to keep everyone on the same page from product managers, program managers, business analyst, developers etc.\nThe main advantage of working with a Gantt Chart is that you get to plan, schedule, and execute your projects on just one chart. The other cool thing is you can track the progress by what has been completed, what is going on and upcoming tasks.\n \nStep 1: Using your excel table Gantt chart data You first need to fo…",

Low code development empowers a citizen developer to quickly put together custom software solutions and increase focus on high-impact business operations.

          "description": "Did you know? It is estimated that 1 in 5 people in the UK have a permanent disability. This number is twice as high when you include situational and temporary impairments. What does this mean in numbers? If you deployed an application to a user group of 1000, around 200 of them will have a permanent disability and another 200 who consider themselves to have a temporary or situational impairment. That is around 400 users who will rely on various features in your application to make their experience better.\n \nAt Microsoft, we're passionate about empowering every person regardless of their condition. Accessibilitech Hackathon is one way Microsoft is committing to empowering people with disabilities to create, consume, and share content in their preferred way. But as a developer, how can you make your applications more accessible especially when building with Microsoft's Power Platform? It's easier than you think!\n \nIn this session on Microsoft Reactor, join Kristine Kolodziejski (Principal Technical Consultant based in the UK) and Japhlet Nwamu (Cloud Advocate at Microsoft) as they would walk you through a few tricks that would\n\nAllow your users to switch themes dynamically,\nAllow your users change font size in your apps dynamically,\nMake your apps multilingual in less than ONE MINUTE\nEnable you integrate text-to-speech in your apps and build your own screen reader,\nGuide you through the do's and don'ts of design,\nHelp you leverage built-in Windows tools to create more accessible design,\nSave user preferences for next time they launch the app! 🤩\n\nTo make it even better, all of these can be achieved WITHOUT premium connectors! Interesting right?\n \nBelow are the details of the session:Event Link: https://www.meetup.com/microsoft-reactor-mea/events/286688825/Date: Tuesday 21st June 2022Time: 5:00PM GMT +1\n \nAt the end of the session, you can watch the recording on demand through the link below.\n \n\n\n\n \n#LetsIncludeAll #AccessibilityInAction",

So, you see, used by a lot of folks by big companies.\n \nWhy was Go created\nAs is often the case, a programming language is created to deal with the shortcomings of other languages. In this case, the creators wanted this new language to have the following capabilities:\n \n\nStatic typing and run-time efficiency from C.\nReadability from JavaScript and Python.\nHigh-performance networking and multi-processing\n\nWhat is it used for though?\nHere's some areas where you are likely to find a Go being used:\n\nCloud based and server-side apps\nDevOp, automation\nCommand line tools\nAI and data science\n\nReferences\nThere's many great resources out there for learning the Go programming language like:\n\nhttps://go.dev/\nhttps://www.tutorialspoint.com/go/index.htm\nhttps://gobyexample.com/\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/go/\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/go-get-started/\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/serverless-go/\nhttps://leanpub.com/go-from-the-beginning FREE book\nGo, from the beginning - YouTube \n\n \nA Go program:\n \n \n \n \npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n fmt.Println(\"hello\")\n}\n \n \n \n \nlook at the readability of the program.

Currently Azure Service Bus uses TLS 1.2 on public endpoints by default, but TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are still supported for backward compatibility.\n \nAzure Service Bus namespaces permit clients to send and receive data with TLS 1.0 and above. To enforce stricter security measures, you can configure your Service Bus namespace to require that clients send and receive data with a newer version of TLS. If a Service Bus namespace requires a minimum version of TLS, then any requests made with an older version will fail. \n \nThanks to your input and feedback, this feature is now in general availability.\n \n\n \nTo learn more, see Enforce a minimum required version of Transport Layer Security (TLS) for requests to a Service Bus namespace.",

Additionally, a temporary outage of a message broker, for example during an upgrade, doesn't render a partitioned queue or topic unavailable, as messages will be retried on a different partition.\n \nSecond, we are …",

Anytime you’re building something new, such as a factory, building or car, and you want to include Internet connected devices or components, you are working within a greenfield scenario. Anytime you want to connect existing devices and assets that may have been around for years to decades, this typically is a brownfield scenario.  The assets or devices were not designed to be network or internet connected by default.

As weaknesses were discovered, new versions of SSL and then TLS were created and although technologies have evolved, so have the tactics of hackers and other cyber criminals.\n \nAs of 2020, TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer supported. TLS 1.2 is required to maintain secure connections and …",

The Azure Desired State Configuration (DSC) extension helps bootstrap a VM to the Azure Automation State Configuration (DSC) service. The DSC extension can be installed on Azure VMs as a Virtual Machine Extension.  The DSCForLinux extension installs the OMI and DSC agent on Azure virtual machines.  \n  \nOver the past year, our team has been developing Automatic Extension Upgrade which now supports the DSC extension. When Automatic Extension Upgrade for the DSC extension is enabled on a VM, the extension is upgraded automatically whenever Microsoft releases a new version for the extension. You can do this by simply setting the flag to true via API, CLI or PowerShell as documented here.  \n   \nSecurity Recommendations  \nWe strongly recommend enabling automatic updates for the DSC extension as soon as possible. This update ensures that customers get important security or performance updates to the extension as soon as possible without manual overhead.  \n   \nAs always, we welcome feedback from customers and partners which supports our efforts to continuously harden our products and services. We want to thank the Wiz team for their collaboration and commitment to helping make Azure customers more secure.",

          "description": "Java Profiler for Azure Monitor Application Insights is now in Public Preview. It is a new capability in Azure Monitor to help Java developers troubleshoot performance issues and uncover performance bottlenecks. \n  \nUnder the hood, it uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to profile your application using a customized configuration.  For additional context, JFR is a tool that collects profiling data of running Java applications, and it is integrated into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). JFR comes with little to barely noticeable overhead cost which makes it great to run on heavily loaded production deployments. \n  \nUsing the customized configuration, you can generate profiles in two ways: \n  \n\nAutomated Profiling - Configure CPU and memory thresholds to automatically trigger a profile recording. \nOn-demand Profiling - Use “Profile Now” to run near real-time profile recording. \n\n To try out the Java Profiler:\n \n\nEnable Azure Monitor Application Insights using v3.4.1 jar file or later. \nEnable the profiler using the java profiler installation guidance and set your CPU/Memory triggers for automatic profiling. \nClick the \"Profiler\" button on the Application Insights Performance Blade and click \"Profile Now\" for an on-demand profile. \nDownload the profiling session when it becomes available (it may take about 5 minutes to show up in Portal). \nView and analyze the profile with Java Mission Control (JMC) or another tool (java profiles are not currently viewable in Portal). \n\n  \n\n \n  \nJava Profiling is in preview today and can be enabled across all your JVMs. Even better, it is included in Application Insights for no additional cost. Try it out and let us know what you think!",

          "description": "Today, we are announcing preview for configuring Azure Monitor VM insights with the Azure Monitor agent - one more reason to migrate to the Azure Monitor agent and unlock its powerful capabilities!\n \nWhat’s changing?\nCurrently, VM insights requires a Log Analytics agent and Dependency agent installed on each virtual machine or virtual machine scale set to be monitored. This preview introduces a version of VM insights that will use the new Azure Monitor agent and would replace the Log Analytics agent. Additionally, it’s not “just” an agent change, you get much more:\n\nCentralized configuration: You can easily set up VM insights using data collection rules (DCR). If you are using Azure portal, VM insights creates a default DCR if one doesn't already exist. You can associate the same DCR with …",

Monthly, Microsoft issues several updates during what is commonly referred to as “Patch Tuesday.” During Patch Tuesday, Microsoft assigns Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) numbers to cloud-based vulnerabilities when there is a specific message that we want to send about necessary action to take, either by our customers to protect themselves or by the industry to protect the ecosystem.\n \nWhen Microsoft issues a CVE, there is almost always action required to be taken by the customer. In instances where customer action is required, Microsoft understands each customer has their own process and timeframe for applying updates. However, we recommen…",
