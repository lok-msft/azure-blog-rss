RAG is a hybrid approach that enhances the capabilities of a language model by incorporating external knowledge. In example: using a RAG approach we can retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base and use them to generate more informed and accurate responses. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a LLM needs up-to-date information or specific domain knowledge that isn't contained within its initial training data.\nThe Components\nTo build our RAG setup, we’ll be using th…",

Or have you already built a web app with Python, but wondered how you can deploy it online? If so, you might be interested in watching this video by and Pamela Fox and Renee Noble, two Python Cloud Advocates at Microsoft with a passion for web development and education!\n \nThey’ll show you how to create a web app with Python Flask (or it’s async-sibling Quart) and show you how you can deploy you can take your web app live by deploying it on Azure. This is the first episode in this live stream series (which you can also catch on demand!) by Pamela and friends covering different web dev frameworks and practices! (And you can catch it in Spanish too!)\n\n\n\n \nIn this video, you will learn how the web works and why you (likely) need a web server to serve up your web app. You will also discover how a backend web framework, like Flask, helps you develop your web server quickly and easily and how it lets you use templates to build dynamic sites - whether it’s your first site or a complex full-scale service.\n \nWant to improve your web server throughput? Find out how you can port your app to Quart, the asynchronous version of Flask. And of course, you’ll see how you can deploy your web apps to Azure App Service in minutes and learn what other deployment options you might be interested in seeking out depending on your project.\n \nThe video is perfect for beginners who have some familiarity with Python, but no prior experience with web development or deployment. It is also suitable for intermediate or advanced developers who want to refresh their skills or learn new tricks. Take a look at the video to learn some concepts and follow along with our coding and deployment demos! You can grab the demo repo here and check out the slides too.",

También explicó las métricas de rendimiento y los resultados del modelo. 10:47\n\n\nPablo Di Loreto presentó algunos servicios de Azure AI que no son generativos, pero útiles para el procesamiento de lenguaje natural y la IA conversacional, como análisis de texto, extracción de frases clave y respuesta a preguntas personalizadas. También demostró cómo usar Language Studio y Azure Bot Service para crear un chatbot con preguntas frecuentes. 21:21\n\n\nLuis Beltrán explicó cómo usar Azure Functions y SQL para crear un motor de búsqueda de productos basado en embeddings. También mostró cómo usar Azure OpenAI para generar embeddings y Azure Communication Services para conectar con WhatsApp. 33:17\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n \nRecursos\nLos materiales están disponibles en este link: https://www.theurlist.com/ainetlatam03\n \nSaludos\nBruno Capuano",

We also answered some of the questions that you asked us in the previous episode, such as:\n\nHow to work with local models\nHow to use semantic kernel\nHow to evaluate different models.\n\n \nOne of the main topics that we discussed was the AI samples repo, where we are adding artificial intelligence samples for .NET developers. You can find scenarios such as text summarization, chat, data generation, image generation, and more. You can also choose between using semantic kernel or the Azure Open AI SDK to interact with the models.\n \nWe also showed you how to switch between different models, such as GPT-4, Phi-3 and Llama, using the same code and API. We also shared some links to other resources, such as the Azure Developer .NET Day, where you can learn more about AI, GitHub Copilot, SQL Server, and other topics.\n \nAnother topic that we covered was the model evaluation sample, which is a work in progress that we are going to present at Build 2024.  (you can check the PR here). The idea behind this sample is to help you evaluate different models that you may want to use or fine-tune for your own applications. We showed you how to use a console application that uses semantic kernel to generate questions and answers, user stories, and other inputs, and then evaluate them using different metrics, such as coherence, groundedness, relevance, and length.\n \nThe full recording is here, \n\n\n\nCheck the next sessions here: .NET Live. \n \nBest,\nBruno",

Refer to the browser network traces provided below.\n\n\n \n\nAnalyze the profiler traces to pinpoint the cause of the reported delay.\n\n\n \n\nAfter examining the demo app's code, it was evident that a deliberate 20-second delay was introduced in the Privacy method within the Home Controller.\n\n\n \n\nNote: Default profiler log collection time is 60 seconds and it is possible to increase the default profiling duration by setting an application setting IIS_PROFILING_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS with a maximum value of 900 (i.e. 15 minutes).",

Deploy as container scenarios are not currently supported, but we plan to introduce this capability at a future date. We also plan to support Python 3.12 in the near future.\n \nWith this feature enabled, the App Service platform will instrument popular Python libraries in your code and automatically channel correlated application-level logs, metrics, and distributed tracing to your Application Insights resource. This will allow you to understand how your Python application is performing and more easily determine the cause of any incidents.\n \nYou can enable the feature at resource creation or from the App Insights blade after your App Service resource is created. Please review our documentation to learn more.\n \nTurn On App Insights during App Service Resource Creation\n \nWhen you create a new Python web application (version 3.11 and lower) using the \"Deploy as code\" option, you can select \"Yes\" on the \"Enable Application Insights\" in the \"Monitoring\" tab. If you select \"Yes\", then your non-containerized Python application will pipe data to an Application Insights resource allowing you to automatically monitor your workloads.\n \n\n \n \nTurn On App Insights after App Service Resource Creation\n \nOpen your App Service application in the portal and go to the App Insights menu item.\n\nSelect \"Enable\" in the toggle under \"Application Insights (Preview)\"\nSelect a location for your Application Insights resource (It’s suggested to create the resource in the same region as the Web App.)",

          "description": "We are pleased to announce the public preview of large message support (up to 20 MB) in Azure Event Hubs. Azure Event Hubs is a cloud native data streaming service that can stream millions of events per second, with low latency, from any source to any destination. Event Hubs is compatible with Apache Kafka, and it enables you to run existing Kafka workloads without any code changes.\n \nThe introduction of large message support is a significant enhancement to our service. Typically, data in streaming scenarios is lightweight, often less than 1 MB, and characterized by high throughput. However, there are instances when messages cannot be divided into smaller segments or chunks.\n \nWith the new support for large messages, Event Hubs self-serve scalable Dedicated clusters can now accommodate events up to 20 MB in size at no additional cost. This capability allows Azure Event Hubs to handle a wide range of message sizes, ensuring uninterrupted business operations.\n \nHow to enable large message support for Event Hubs\n \nLarge message streaming is only supported in Event Hubs self-serve scalable dedicated clusters built out of latest infrastructure. For more details, visit aka.ms/largemessagesupportforeh\n \nBeing able to stream large messages or events requires no client code changes apart from the change in message or event itself. You could continue sending/receiving messages using any existing event hubs SDK / Kafka API to stream large messages to event hub.\n \nWe’re all ears for your feedback.

By retaining deleted data for a specified period, it ensures data integrity and availability, even in the event of human error.

          "description": "The article discusses a problem where numerous messages end up in the dead letter queue (DLQ) when the JMS service bus consumer connects to the Azure Service Bus using Qpid jars. The reason for the messages being dead-lettered is that they have reached the maximum delivery count.\n \nThe fundamental issue stems from Apache Qpid's message handling. Qpid utilizes a local buffer to prefetch messages from the Azure Service Bus, storing them prior to delivery to the consumer. The complication occurs when Qpid prefetches an excessive number of messages that the consumer is unable to process within the lock duration. Consequently, the consumer is unable to acknowledge or finalize the processing of these messages before the lock expires, leading to an accumulation of messages in the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).\n \nTo address this problem, it is crucial to either turn off Qpid's local buffer or modify the prefetch count. Disabling prefetching is achievable by setting jms.prefetchPolicy.all=0 in the JMS client. This configuration allows the JMS client to directly consume messages from the Azure Service Bus, circumventing Qpid's local buffer. Consequently, the consumer can process messages at a suitable pace, guaranteeing smooth processing and issue-free completion.\n \nWhy is Prefetch not the default option in Microsoft .NET/Java/Python libs?",

          "description": "Enhancing Disaster Recovery and Ransomware Protection with Azure VMware Solution and JetStream Software\n \nDisaster Recovery (DR) and ransomware protection are critical concerns for organizations today, as the frequency and cost of attacks continue to rise. Our customers demand comprehensive and cost-effective options to safeguard their critical workloads without compromising application performance.\n \nAVS collaborates with leading technology companies, such as JetStream Software, to deliver advanced DR solutions that offer both near-zero Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) and near-zero Recovery Time Objective (RTO) options. The JetStream DR and Ransomware solution implements Continuous Data Protection (CDP) by immediately replicating all data generated by protected VMs. It employs heuristic algorithms to detect data tampering by utilizing cost-effective and high-performance storage options like Azure Blob Storage, Azure NetApp Files (ANF), and ESAN-based solutions. Utilizing the VMware-certified VAIO APIs means that the JetStream solution is fully VMware Ready certified. This approach is unique compared to other market offerings that provide DR protection by creating intermittent snapshots.\n \nJetStream has also partnered with Microsoft to develop a unique feature that rehydrates VMs and their data from Azure Blob object storage, deploying them to AVS nodes provisioned on-demand, to a pilot light cluster in AVS. This ensures a rapid and cost-controlled recovery that minimizes downtime in the event of a disaster or ransomware attack.\n \nTo learn more about the power of this integration, watch our sessions at VMware Explore 2024 in Las Vegas:\n\n“Future-Proof VMware Workloads with Azure VMware Solution” [Session ID: VCFB2530LVS]\n“Implementing a Robust BCDR Plan with Azure VMware Solution” [Session ID: VCFB2534LVS]\n“Discover the Partner Ecosystem for Azure VMware Solution” [Session ID: VCFB2532LVS]",

These include using a more powerful agent setup, using a different data pipeline, allocating more memory for agent, and more. All these changes are made in the background by the service and do not require input or configuration from customers. \nHigh Scale mode impacts only the data collection layer (with a new DCR) – the rest of the experience remains the same. Data flows to our existing tables, your queries and alerts work as before too. High Scale mode is available to all customers but requires customers to opt-in to use. \n \nTo get started with High Scale mode, please see our documentation at https://aka.ms/cihsmode.",

Today we’re excited to share a massive upgrade to the network observability capabilities available to AKS customers. \n \nWhat’s new?\nWe are excited to announce Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS), a suite of services built to significantly enhance the operational capabilities of your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. Advanced Network Observability is the inaugural feature of the ACNS suite bringing the power of Hubble’s control plane to both Cilium and Non-Cilium Linux data planes. With Advanced Network Observability, customers can now pinpoint network-related issues with more precision and detect root causes faster.  The offering provides pod level packet statistics, DNS statistics, L4 connections and enhanced debugging capabilities with network flow logs and DNS error tracking.\nData flow for Advanced Network Observability\n \nHow can Azure customers use the new offering?\nACNS is integrated deeply with existing Azure Monitor capabilities for monitoring AKS clusters. Using the new capabilities requires no extra configuration from customers. Customers can enable advanced network observability with a single command. The metrics are then ingested automatically by Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus. Additionally, customers can visualize the metrics in pre-built dashboards in Azure Managed Grafana. Customers have access to 6 pre-built dashboards in Azure Managed Grafana covering a breadth of signals from cluster traffic to DNS and pod level flows.\n \nPod flows dashboard built into Azure Manged Grafana\n \n \nHow to get ACNS\nTo get started with ACNS capabilities, please see our onboarding documentation\n \nRead more about ACNS:\n\nDocumentation: What is Advanced Container Networking Services?\nAzure Blog:  Announcing Advanced Container Networking Services for your Azure Kubernetes Service clusters",
