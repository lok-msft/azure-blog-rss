It has been just over two years since we initially announced this new project, and we have come a long way since its initial development. The project has a full feature set, and the APIs have stabilized and matured over this time. A lot of effort and care was put into this project to ensure that it can grow and adapt over the next few years.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring Authorization Server 1.0 will be based on Spring Security 6.0, which will be based off of Spring Framework 6.0 and will require a minimum of JDK 17 at runtime, as well as a minimum of Tomcat 10 or Jetty 11 (for Jakarta EE 9 compatibility).

My family and I love Hawaii. It’s brimming with beauty and serenity, and while the island of Maui, in the state of Hawaii, is very small, the islands are humbling. They make you feel so very small. It’s surreal to sit there on the beach as the sun creeps down beyond the horizon and to realize there’s nothing but pitch black darkness and water for as far as you can see, starting just a few meters away. It’s endless. It has no end. Like the bugs in code. Endless.

          "description": "Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! How are you? This week I’m writing you from sunny Seattle, Washington, where we’re having our next installment of the SpringOne Tour series. It’s been a ton of fun seeing all these fun and friendly faces again and getting to see people, many of whom I haven’t seen since before the pandemic! I’ve also had a lot of fun seeing some friends from some of the big cloud companies here, Microsoft and AWS. It’s always interesting to learn how people are using the latest and greatest from Spring to build amazing systems and software targeting these cloud platforms.\n\r\nWe’ve got a lot to cover this week so let’s dive right into it!\n\r\n\r\n  \nIn last week’s podcast, I talked to Kubernetes contributor and fellow Tanzu Developer Advocate Leigh Capili\n\r\n  \nDistributed Tracing With OpenTelemetry, Spring Cloud Sleuth, Kafka, and Jaeger\n\r\n  \nIngress vs. Load Balancer in Kubernetes\n\r\n  \nInstantiating Multiple Beans of the Same Class with Spring Annotations\n\r\n  \nCurious about when and why to use Java 14 Records vs. Lombok? Check out this article\n\r\n  \nI put together this little example , thanks to Reactor lead Simon Baslé, showing how to handle pagination with the expand operator in Project Reactor: Pagination in a Reactive Application. It looks at how to eleganrly expand the contents of a reactive stream as new data (in a data pagination scenario) becomes available.\n\r\n  \nSpring Shell 2.1.0-RC1 is now available\n\r\n  \nPushing a Docker Image to a Self-Hosted Registry\n\r\n  \nSpring for Apache Kafka 2.9 Release Candidate Available\n\r\n  \nThis Apache Maven Survival Guide is quite interesting, to me at least!",

Shasta, Crater Lake, Lassen National Park, etc. It was a ton of fun, and a lot of driving! Anyway, it all kinda blurs together and felt like just one weekend, and today feels like Monday. I only just realized it was Tuesday! And you know what that means?

          "description": "Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! How are you? It’s been a hot minute since we last chatted. I was in Germany this time last week. Now, I’m back in beautiful San Francisco. Today the weather will climb to a monumental 84 F! That’s very unusual, for any time of the year, here in San Francisco. Most places here in San Francisco don’t have air conditioning. Some have heating. I bought a brand new condo in 2014 and it didn’t have air conditioning. You just open the window. I am privileged enough that I have air conditioning today, of course. I mention all this to say that it’s hot here! I worry for the elderly! When it gets this hot, the YMCA and other organizations typically invite elderly people to come in and get some cool air and water. It’s dangerous. Some days it gets even hotter.

Even if you don’t expect as many users as requests per second, it’s important to discover your application’s breakpoint and verify that your application can recover without a lot of effort. It also helps in understanding which component of your application fails first and why.\nAs the product manager for Azure Load Testing, I've been working with many customers to validate our preview release.

Sometimes, you may want to add custom configurations via web.xml file.\n \nBefore talking about how to change web.xml file in App Service windows, let's discuss \"what is web.xml\"?\n \nJava web applications use a deployment descriptor file to determine how URLs map to servlets, which URLs require authentication, and other information. This file is named web.xml and resides in the app's WAR under the WEB-INF/ directory. web.xml is part of the servlet standard for web applications.\n \nThe default Servlet configurations is under ${catalina.home}/conf. For each webapp, the settings could be found under ${catalina.home}/webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF.\n \nWhen tomcat deploys the application, it reads the generic configurations from conf/web.xml and then WEB-INF/web.xml in the web application. \n \nIt instructs the Tomcat which classes to load, what parameters to set in the context, and how to intercept requests coming from browsers.\nThere you specify:\n\nwhat servlets (and filters) you want to use and what URLs you want to map them to\nlisteners - classes that are notified when some events happen (context starts, session created, etc)\nconfiguration parameters (context-params)\nerror pages, welcome files\nsecurity constraints\n\nBack to our topic, if you haven't defined a custom error page, you will the default page as below:\n\n \nTo add a custom error page, please follow below steps:\n\nAdd <error-page></error-page> in web.xml under webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF. For example, my custom error page \"error.html\" is under root folder /webapp, so I should use \"/error.html\" in <location></location>.\n\n\n\nAdd your custom error in webapps folder.\n\n\n\nBuild and re-deploy the project to App Service.\nNow you will see the custom error page replace the default one.\n\n\n \nPlease kindly note, configurations won't take effect if you add web.xml directly in Kudu site.

A good way to do that, is to store your secrets and settings in a central service. Azure provides a service like that, and it's called Azure App Configuration.\nAzure App Configuration can store secrets and settings for you in a central place, so that your application doesn't have to store them in source code. On top of that, it has the ability to manage feature flags. These are settings that you use in your application to enable or disable features, like a new menu-item that is only visible when the feature flag 'beta' is enabled. This allows you to deploy changes to production, and only ma…",

When the built-in user flows don't cut it you have to create custom policies based on XML, but it has been a somewhat bumpy ride getting the custom policies you craft uploaded to Azure. In the beginning you could only do it through the Azure Portal which made for a manual and error-prone deployment process. After a couple of interim improvements along the way we have eventually gotten to where it's possible to have an Azure DevOps based pipeline setup  invoking REST APIs to get the policies into the right place.

It’s open source and is not tied to any processing framework, data model or programming language. Parquet is ideal for storing any kind of big data and is built to support efficient compression and encoding schemes.  \n \nCapture streaming data in Parquet format using Event Hubs\nUsing Azure Event Hubs, no code editor for event processing, you can automatically capture streaming data in an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account in Parquet format. The no code editor allows you to easily develop an Azure Stream Analytics job without writing a single line of code.\n \n\nOnce data is captured, any analytics service of your choice can process or analyze Parquet data. \n \nGet Started Today\nYou can try out Apache Parquet capturing feature in Azure Event Hubs using the following links.\n\nTo try out Parquet capturing feature, follow Capture data from Event Hubs in Parquet format.\nYou can follow the tutorial on Capture Event Hubs data in Parquet format and analyze with Azure Synapse Analytics. \nTo learn more about no code editor in Event Hubs for event stream processing, check out No code stream processing using Azure Stream Analytics (Preview).",

This past year, we have been working to support customers more holistically, shipping the public preview of  “Apply and Monitor” and “Apply and Autocorrect” assignment types, and are working hard on the upcoming GA of these capabilities.\n \nWe have been listening to our customers as well as the community and are excited to announce a name that highlights the current and future capabilities of our service. Guest configuration will become machine configuration. In addition to the name change, we are moving under the Automanage brand umbrella to reinforce the message that the goal of machine configuration is to reduce op-ex and customer burden in managing their Windows and Linux machines both in Azure and on-premises. It is important to note that the current experience within policy will not change. Customers will still be able to apply machine configurations at scale through policy assignments as they have thus far. \n \nThis rebranding will go live soon in the Azure portal as well as our documentation.

With this new experience our customers can view and edit table properties directly from Azure Portal->Log Analytics workspaces. Up until now, this was only possible using the Tables REST API or CLI.\n \nIn this blog you will learn how to manage each table’s plan and retention and archiving policy using the Azure Portal's Tables experience - which was lately introduced in preview.\n \nFrom the Log Analytics workspaces menu, select Tables (preview).\nThe Tables screen lists all the tables in the workspace with their properties:\n\nType: Azure table \\ Custom table \\ Search results \\ Restored logs\nPlan: Analytics \\ Basic\nRetention properties:\n\nInteractive retention\nArchive period\nTotal retention period\n\n\n\n\n \nTo edit a specific table setting, select the context menu of the table you want to configure and select Manage table.\n\n \nFrom the table’s configuration screen you can:\n\nEdit the table’s Plan.By default, all tables in your workspace are Analytics tables. You can configure particular tables to use Basic Logs. The list of tables that are applicable to Basic plan can be found here. You can read here about the differences between Analytics and Basic Logs plans.\nConfigure the retention and archive duration in Data retention settings section.By default, all tables in your workspace inherit the workspace retention and have no archive. From the Data retention settings section you can set the retention policies for individual tables: Interactive retention and Total retention, and the Archive retention value is calculated as (Total – Interactive).\nNote: \nSelecting a longer retention period will incur additional charges. For more information see our pricing page.Selecting a shorter retention period may result in some data loss.",
