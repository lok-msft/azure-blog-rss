Having these paths simplifies the development process, lets developers focus on their applications instead of infrastructure and speeds time to production. Microsoft and VMware have partnered to make Azure Spring Apps a golden path for deploying and scaling Spring applications in the cloud. And with new capabilities like the scale to zero and developer productivity enhancements, Azure Spring Apps now offers an even more economical and optimized route to get your Spring applications into production.\n1.

Spring Cloud Stream version 3.0.0 moved the Schema Registry components into a top-level spring-cloud project, and Spring Cloud Stream included those in its BOM for the end user applications to consume them. However, this didn’t scale well, and with the 3.2 version, we decided to stop having them as part of the Spring Cloud Stream BOM. \n\r\nThe schema registry use ca…",

I was just at Devoxx in Belgium, where hundreds of experts from across the Java ecosystem converged for the first time since 2019 to deliver their biggest and best. \n\r\nI could do a proper trip report, but I really just came here to point you to two talks from two of my amazing teammates, Stéphane Nicoll (@snicoll) and Brian Clozel (@bclozel), who have been very hard at work on both Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, both of which will land by the end of November, 2022. These are brand new generations of the framework, implying huge new paradigms and new opportunities for developers. \n\r\nThis first is a broader, whirlwind tour of the new features in Spring Framework 6 (which bubble up into Spring Boot 3).\n\r\n\r\nThis second one introduces the new ahead-of-time (AOT) support in Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, which makes it trivial to build GraalVM native images.\n\r\n\n\r\nNB: please ignore the metadata for the YouTube videos. Both talks feature both speakers, and there is no mention whatsoever of React and JavaScript and the like. I think that was a metadata issue with the publication of the videos on YouTube, which will hopefully be resolved. \n\r\nEnjoy! \n\r\nIf you missed this event, that’s OK - there’s still time to join the Spring team and larger Java ecosystem for SpringOne, being held 6-8 December, 2022, in sunny San Francisco, CA, 94105!

          "description": "A picture showing .NET\nWhat is .NET MAUI?\n.NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) is a cross-platform framework for creating native mobile and desktop apps with C# and XAML. Using .NET MAUI, you can develop apps that can run on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows from a single shared code-base.\nUsing .NET MAUI, you can create multi-platform apps using a single project, but you can add platform-specific source code and resources if necessary. One of the key aims of .NET MAUI is to enable you to implement as much of your app logic and UI layout as possible in a single code-base.\n \nIn this blog, we will cover how to Build a Water Consumption Mobile App using .NET MAUI that consumes historical data from a Web API. This solution is part of a project build for .NET Conf Student Zone 2022\n \nWhat will we be doing?\nBefore you can get started, we need a few things set up first:\n\nBuild a Mininal API from scratch to consume in your app\nBuild your first .NET MAUI App\nAdd a Consumption.cs class with the following propertiesA picture showing the Consumption.cs class\nAdd a APIManager.cs class to house the HTTP methods for your APIA picture showing the APIManager.cs class\n\nAfter the above are added, you can start to:\n\nConsume A Web API – this will show how you to consume the historical data stored in the Web API and display on your mobile app.\nSend data to your Web API using the HTTP Post Method (shown in the link above too).\n\n \nWe have a dedicated Microsoft learn module that will show you how to Consume and Send Data to your Web API. All of the code for this part of the project and other parts are available on the .NET Student Zone Githup Repositry\n \nTo see and understand the how to implement this in Visual Studio you can watch my session below.\n\nFinally, if you are curious about where the API data comes from, you can explore the other sessions of the .Net Student Conf and understand how all the different pieces and different technologies of .NET ecosystem are combined together into a single e-2-e project.",

In short terms, GitHub is known as the developer's best friend. \nAs software and technologies continue to evolve, also Github platform and services are constantly evolving. In this blog post, I wish to show you how the latest Git tools, GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Copilot, can transform and support the world of education.\n \nIn the following video, you'll be listening about two stories, whose scenarios will be familiar to anyone who is studying or teaching at University, or simply anyone who ever learned a new programming language/framework or prepared a hands-on workshop to deliver. \nThe first story's character is Ali, a Data Science teacher at the University of Nowhere. She is preparing for her spring semester course and in particular, she’s preparing a guided tutorial, with a full list of all the instructions her students will need to set up the environment for her Python lab.\nThe second story is about Mark. Mark is a student at University of Nowhere. He attended the Python data science lab by prof Ali and now he needs to complete the assignment at home. However, he gets stuck at some point.\n \nHow Github Codespaces and Github Copilot will help them and make their tasks easier? Watch the video below to find out the answer.\n\n\n\n \nUseful resources:\n\nLearn more about GitHub for Education and all the benefits for students and educators.\nExplore and build upon all the GitHub Codespaces templates for education.\nIf you missed GitHub Universe, read all the latest announcements. \nLearn more about Visual Studio Code and VS Code Extenstions which make it even easier to harness GitHub Codespaces.",

And if you are familiar with .NET framework, ML.NET could be an easy win!

          "description": "Before joining Microsoft, I spent three semesters teaching Python in UC Berkeley’s CS61A, the first class in their CS sequence. I really liked Python as a teaching language and as a first language for many students, due to its relatively low usage of punctuation and its tendency to read like an English sentence.\nHowever, as it is a text-based language, there are still many frustrating ways to mess up a Python program – spelling things wrong, indenting incorrectly, not using the right function for the job, etc. – and new programmers can have a particularly hard time understanding how to fix incorrect code. Teachers and TAs can help students decipher errors, but we’re not always around when they’re coding, especially in large classes (my class size ranged from 1000-2000!).\nThat’s why I’m ver…",

          "description": "Test driven development (TDD)\nTest driven development, or TDD, is a method of directly coupling testing with every part of your daily development. Developers who use TDD typically start developing by first writing a test that fails, and then writing the code that makes the test pass. This approach means that product code is more likely to get high test coverage, and the tests typically come first.\n \nMany developers find this pattern useful to help them prioritize good architecture from the start of development, and to stay laser-focused on each part of the functionality they need to implement. This school of thought advocates for testing not being an after-thought of development, but rather a driving force.\n \nFor example, in the following image, you can see that AddTest is written and fail…",

          "description": "Many work apps need the ability to schedule a meeting with others in their organization. Here's how to do it for apps connected to Microsoft 365.\n \nWork apps need work data\nWork apps serve a specific purpose: they help you track projects, follow orders or manage resources. But rarely do they contain all the information that users need to complete their work. Typically, information about people, their calendars, or communication is stored elsewhere, like in Microsoft 365. And that's a shame because completing a task requires users to switch between different apps, which is detrimental to their productivity. Unless of course, you bring work data into your work app.\n \nFind a meeting time and schedule a meeting on Microsoft 365\nA common scenario for work apps is to schedule a meeting with others in the organization. While it sounds trivial, the app must be able to access attendees' calendars, find a suitable meeting time and schedule the meeting. And that's where Microsoft Graph comes in.\n \nRecently I published an article on freeCodeCamp that shows you how to build an app connected to Microsoft 365 that can find a meeting time and schedule a meeting.\n \n\n \nThe app shows you how to make the best use of features available in the Microsoft Graph Toolkit and Microsoft Graph to build a UI that you could integrate with another app.\n \nWant to learn more joing our 30 days of Graph challenge runs from November 1-30, 2022. Watch  this short YouTube video to find out why you should participate! \n \nRegister for the 30 Days of Microsoft Graph Challenge today.\n \nCheck it out, and I'm looking forward to hearing what you think!",

It shows you how to get information from the user's calendar and check their availability for a particular time slot. And it's also a great way to get started with building apps on Microsoft 365.\n \nThe tutorial shows you the basics of setting up auth in a single-page app and using the Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK to connect to the Microsoft Graph API. It also demonstrates working with calendar views and formatting dates.This is just one of many scenarios and types of apps that you can implement on Microsoft 365. For more information about the type of data and insights stored on Microsoft 365 that you can tap into, check out the Microsoft Graph API documentation.\n \nGive it a try, and we're looking forward to hearing what you think.\n30 Days of Microsoft Graph is a gamified learning experience for beginners to challenge themselves on building apps with Microsoft Graph and JavaScript based on the Top Microsoft Graph Scenarios, for a chance to win exciting prizes.\n\n \nThe challenge will start on November 1st and end on November 30th.

Toolkit's components help you retrieve relevant data from Microsoft 365 and show it in your app in any way you want. And with toolkit's authentication providers, setting up auth is a matter of adding a few lines of code. Never again fiddle with setting up a login, handling access tokens, building web requests, and dealing with errors.\n \nLearn Microsoft Graph Toolkit interactively\nTo help you learn what Microsoft Graph Toolkit has to offer and how you'd use it in your app, we recently released a new learning path on Microsoft Learn. By following a few learn modules you'll learn everything that you need to know to use the toolkit in your app. But that's not all.\nThinking about the different ways in which people learn, we've launched an experiment - an interactive code tour that you can follow to add Microsoft Graph Toolkit to a React app.\n\n \n\n \nBy following the instructions in the tour, you gradually extend an empty React app with Microsoft Graph Toolkit turning it into a true Microsoft 365 app. What's cool about this code tour, is that it puts the code of your app in the center. Rather than reading long-form, you're in the code and get relevant, and in-place tips for building your app.\n \nThe Microsoft Graph Toolkit React code tour is a great way to quickly experience how you'd use the toolkit in a React app. We'd love it if you gave it a try and told us what you think. Shall we consider building tours for other technologies and scenarios?\n \nTry the Microsoft Graph Toolkit React code tour",

These apps can tap into data and insights stored on Microsoft 365 and bring them into people's workflows.\n \nBuilding for a platform\nBuilding for a platform isn't trivial. It comes with all kinds of specific knowledge you have to have like what tooling, SDKs, and APIs to use, how to integrate your app, and finally how to package and distribute it. What many people forget though, is that you don't have to learn everything about everything at once. Often, you can start simple and build up from there.\n \nBuild your first Microsoft 365 app in just 10 minutes\nRecently, I published an article on freeCodeCamp that shows you how you can build your first Microsoft 365 app in just 10 minutes.\n\n \n\n \nSure, the app is simple and doesn't do much, but when building it, you'll learn the fundamental concepts of building apps on Microsoft 365. And after these 10 minutes, you'll have a functional app that works and retrieves data from Microsoft 365, and which you can use as a starting point for more complex apps.\n \nGive it a try, and we're looking forward to hearing what you think.",

This is a tool that clearly outlines tasks and to which teams they have been assigned to. This helps you to manage the whole project in an efficient manner by taking note of the projection timeline. You get to keep everyone on the same page from product managers, program managers, business analyst, developers etc.\nThe main advantage of working with a Gantt Chart is that you get to plan, schedule, and execute your projects on just one chart. The other cool thing is you can track the progress by what has been completed, what is going on and upcoming tasks.\n \nStep 1: Using your excel table Gantt chart data You first need to fo…",

However, one of the pitfall is that students can easily change the unit test codes and GitHub actions workflow and educators cannot trust the automatic grading result. Another problem is that students must commit and push source code themselves. Educators therefore have no idea if students are copying from other or not. Also, educators don’t know how students develop their answer, and the details of every code change. \nSolution\nTo solve the potential cheating problem and to move from passive to active learning, we need a source of truth to run unit test and keep all changes of source codes when students are writing codes.\nFirst, we create .vscode/settings.json to enable auto save…",

In many cases the information passed can be a file or a blob. Each of these ISVs would need to implement such a service. In the past few months, I discussed this capability with several (over 4) different customers, each with slightly unique needs. When I tried to generalize the need, it was clear: they wanted a quick, safe means to exchange files with customers or devices. \n \nSo, I tried to translate these asks into user stories: \n \nAs a service provider, I need my customers to upload content in a secure, easy-to-maintain micro-service exposed as an API (application programming interfaces) so that I can process the content uploaded and perform an action on it. \n  \nA…",

          "description": "Have you ever noticed the dash lines on the \"Availability\" Azure Monitor metric for your Storage Account? What's that about? Is your Storage Account down?\n \nWhy is it that we see sections where there is a dashed line and other sections where there is a solid line?\n \n\n \nWell, it turns out that Azure metrics charts use dashed line style to indicate that there is a missing value (also known as “null value”) between two known time grain data points. Meaning, this behavior is by design, yes, by design. It is useful for identifying missing data points. The line chart is a superior choice for visualizing trends of high-density metrics but may be difficult to interpret for the metrics with sparse values, especially when corelating values with time grain is important.\n \nThe dashed line makes readin…",

          "description": "Problem statement:\nAzure Cache for Redis has many uses, including data caching and session management. Many a times we see a sudden burst of traffic on our application, pushes our Azure Redis Cache under stress due to increased operations, active connections, memory usage etc. This causes cache's Server Load to spike, which adversely impacts application performance.\n \nServer Load is the percentage of cycles in which the Redis server is busy processing and not waiting idle for messages. If this counter reaches 100, it means the Redis server has hit a performance ceiling and the CPU can't process work any faster. If you're seeing high Redis Server Load, then you see timeout exceptions in the client. In this case, you should consider scaling up or partitioning your data into multiple caches.\n…",

The Azure Desired State Configuration (DSC) extension helps bootstrap a VM to the Azure Automation State Configuration (DSC) service. The DSC extension can be installed on Azure VMs as a Virtual Machine Extension.  The DSCForLinux extension installs the OMI and DSC agent on Azure virtual machines.  \n  \nOver the past year, our team has been developing Automatic Extension Upgrade which now supports the DSC extension. When Automatic Extension Upgrade for the DSC extension is enabled on a VM, the extension is upgraded automatically whenever Microsoft releases a new version for the extension. You can do this by simply setting the flag to true via API, CLI or PowerShell as documented here.  \n   \nSecurity Recommendations  \nWe strongly recommend enabling automatic updates for the DSC extension as soon as possible. This update ensures that customers get important security or performance updates to the extension as soon as possible without manual overhead.  \n   \nAs always, we welcome feedback from customers and partners which supports our efforts to continuously harden our products and services.

With preview feedback addressed and services now fully scaled out to meet the complex needs of these users and more, we are today excited to announce the revamped custom logs features are now generally available!\n \nToday, we are announcing the following:\n\nGA of the Log Ingestion API. This secure, scalable, and flexible API is the path going forward for all custom data ingestion needs.\nGA of the Ingestion-time Transformations feature. This feature allows users to customize built-in data streams to parse, enrich, filter, or otherwise tailor incoming data to their specific use-cases.\nA pricing for data sent to the system and subsequently dropped in a transformation. A nominal fee per GB dropped will be charged for any data dropped beyond 50% of incoming data, calculated daily. The fee is waived for Azure Sentinel-enabled workspaces. While we're announcing billing today, we will not start charging yet as of this announcement, and will provide at least a 3-month notice before doing so. The Azure Monitor pricing page will be imminently updated with these details.\n\n \nScreenshot of ingestion-time transformation UI\n \n \n \nFor those of you who participated in our preview - thank you for your feedback, and to those new to the features - we're excited for you to start using them!

          "description": "Java Profiler for Azure Monitor Application Insights is now in Public Preview. It is a new capability in Azure Monitor to help Java developers troubleshoot performance issues and uncover performance bottlenecks. \n  \nUnder the hood, it uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to profile your application using a customized configuration.  For additional context, JFR is a tool that collects profiling data of running Java applications, and it is integrated into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). JFR comes with little to barely noticeable overhead cost which makes it great to run on heavily loaded production deployments. \n  \nUsing the customized configuration, you can generate profiles in two ways: \n  \n\nAutomated Profiling - Configure CPU and memory thresholds to automatically trigger a profile recording. \nOn-demand Profiling - Use “Profile Now” to run near real-time profile recording. \n\n To try out the Java Profiler:\n \n\nEnable Azure Monitor Application Insights using v3.4.1 jar file or later. \nEnable the profiler using the java profiler installation guidance and set your CPU/Memory triggers for automatic profiling. \nClick the \"Profiler\" button on the Application Insights Performance Blade and click \"Profile Now\" for an on-demand profile. \nDownload the profiling session when it becomes available (it may take about 5 minutes to show up in Portal). \nView and analyze the profile with Java Mission Control (JMC) or another tool (java profiles are not currently viewable in Portal). \n\n  \n\n \n  \nJava Profiling is in preview today and can be enabled across all your JVMs. Even better, it is included in Application Insights for no additional cost. Try it out and let us know what you think!",

This preview introduces a version of VM insights that will use the new Azure Monitor agent and would replace the Log Analytics agent. Additionally, it’s not “just” an agent change, you get much more:\n\nCentralized configuration: You can easily set up VM insights using data collection rules (DCR). If you are using Azure portal, VM insights creates a default DCR if one doesn't already exist. You can associate the same DCR with …",
