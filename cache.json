The most exciting feature for me is an Observability which is spread throughout the Spring portfolio from now on.\r\nNevertheless, today I’d like to share with a project I’m working on since holidays, where the mentioned observability makes a perfect sense, too.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ll start from the far.\r\nLet’s imagine we are learning a new programming language! I do learn Go to better understand Kubernetes, for example.\r\nOf course, we deal with some primitives and basic structures, first of all.\r\nThen we implement some well-known algorithms like bubble sort, Fibonacci number or sqrt function to get used to the language style and expectations.\r\nAnd now what?\r\nWe have some real use-cases where this or that functionality…",

          "description": "Hot on the heels of Spring Boot 3.0.2, I am excited to announce the 0.3 release of Spring Modulith.\r\nThe release is packed with improvements.\r\nWe have tweaked a couple of things that might require your attention and a couple of adapting changes to your code.\r\nThe most notable changes are:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-114 – We renamed the ….modulith.model package to ….modulith.core. This primarily affects ApplicationModules. Please adapt your imports accordingly.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-120 – The documentation support now generates diagram files using the *.puml file extension, as suggested by PlantUML. Please adapt your imports accordingly.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-103 – ApplicationModuleInitializer implementations will be triggered upon application startup, in the order following the application module dependency structure (more core ones are invoked first). Also, ApplicationModules exposes a ….getComparator() to order Spring beans that way. Note, that this requires the JGraphT library to be on the classpath (automatically pulled in via the spring-modulith-runtime artifact). See the reference documentation for details.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-116 – PublishedEvents now sees events published from asynchronous event listeners, too.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-100 – If you’re using AssertJ in your tests, you can now use AssertablePublishedEvents for a more streamlined integration  (for example, assertThat(events).contains(MyEvent.class).matching(…)).\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-117 – As we incentivize event-based, asynchronous application module integration, the test starter now also pulls in Awaitility.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-111 – We now publish aggregated Javdoc.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFind a complete change log in the GitHub release page. We are looking forward to your feedback in the GitHub discussions.",

In contrast to that, upgrading to a new minor or even a new major version requires more work, including code changes to adapt to new or changed APIs, updating configurations to not use deprecated keys anymore, and more.\n\r\nEach new minor or major version of Spring therefore ships with a comprehensive guide and documentation about those changes and you can read and follow to upgrade your project.

I went to Helsinki, Finland, last week, and this week I’m in Atlanta, Georgia, to speak at the Atlanta Java User Group. And, of course, next week, I’ll be in New York to join a viewing party for the airing of SpringOne Essentials. You’re going to join us, I trust? It’s going to be awesome! \n\r\n\r\nLook, it’s Tuesday. Tuesdays are no fun. We’re three solid days away from fun winter ski slopes from Friday. But that’s OK because every day is a chance to learn. And this week’s no exception: we’ve got a ton to look at it, so let’s dive right into it! \n\r\n\r\n  \nA Bootiful Podcast: Mario Fusco, the Drools rules engine project lead and fellow Java Champion\n\r\n  \nComplex Event Processing with Esper and Spring Boot\n\r\n  \nSpring Boot Multi-tenant Architecture Overview\n\r\n  \nSpring Data 2022.0.1 and 2021.2.7 available\n\r\n  \nSpring Framework 5.3.25 available now\n\r\n  \nSpring Framework 6.0.4 available now\n\r\n  \nSpring MVC – Mapping the Root URL to a Page\n\r\n  \nSpring Shell 2.1.5 and 3.0.0-RC1 are now available\n\r\n  \nEasy JVM Observability with the JCMD CLI\n\r\n  \nThis is super cool: GraalVM Native Image meets RISC-V Even cooler? The implementation might pave the way for GraalVM compilation to WebAssembly… Imagine, friends. One day, through the magic of open source, we could compile a Spring Boot application to WebAssembly. What a time to be alive!\n\r\n  \nImplementing Retry In Kafka Consumer\n\r\n  \nRecords Are Here! Can We Remove Lombok Already?\n\r\n  \nRelease v6.0.0-M0 · jobrunr/jobrunr. First milestone.

I’m in a warm cozy office. Good music is playing. People are asleep in my home. I can hear the raindrops and wind outside the window. I’m at peace as I code. And code I have. I’ve been updating my blog, and a half dozen little side projects, to the new Spring Boot 3. This has given me a chance to do a little, shall we say, Spring cleaning, and also update my Github Actions to the latest and greatest. I’m pleasantly surprised by how many builds I’ve switched over to 3.0 and then used the AOT engine to build a GraalVM native image and it just worked! \n\r\nHow were or are your holidays going?

See my friends on the Spring team in person since the pandemic descended. And, I’m overjoyed to relate, I’ve just had the privilege of a nice meeting with several of them last night. And I’m going to see more of them today! Seriously. I feel like I won the lottery. I’ve missed my friends. Hug your friends and family, friends. You never know when the next pandemic (or life in general) will put distance between you and them. So, in order to close that distance, I’m going to go back to meetings with them, and I’ll leave you with yet another week’s curated list of content.

Spring Cloud Stream version 3.0.0 moved the Schema Registry components into a top-level spring-cloud project, and Spring Cloud Stream included those in its BOM for the end user applications to consume them. However, this didn’t scale well, and with the 3.2 version, we decided to stop having them as part of the Spring Cloud Stream BOM. \n\r\nThe schema registry use ca…",

I was just at Devoxx in Belgium, where hundreds of experts from across the Java ecosystem converged for the first time since 2019 to deliver their biggest and best. \n\r\nI could do a proper trip report, but I really just came here to point you to two talks from two of my amazing teammates, Stéphane Nicoll (@snicoll) and Brian Clozel (@bclozel), who have been very hard at work on both Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, both of which will land by the end of November, 2022. These are brand new generations of the framework, implying huge new paradigms and new opportunities for developers. \n\r\nThis first is a broader, whirlwind tour of the new features in Spring Framework 6 (which bubble up into Spring Boot 3).\n\r\n\r\nThis second one introduces the new ahead-of-time (AOT) support in Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, which makes it trivial to build GraalVM native images.\n\r\n\n\r\nNB: please ignore the metadata for the YouTube videos. Both talks feature both speakers, and there is no mention whatsoever of React and JavaScript and the like. I think that was a metadata issue with the publication of the videos on YouTube, which will hopefully be resolved. \n\r\nEnjoy! \n\r\nIf you missed this event, that’s OK - there’s still time to join the Spring team and larger Java ecosystem for SpringOne, being held 6-8 December, 2022, in sunny San Francisco, CA, 94105!

In this blog post, we will go through the three main components of a data protection plan as well as the initial deployment goals for establishing a Zero Trust approach to data security.\n \nKnow your data\nThis is the first step in safeguarding data with Zero Trust. It is vital to identify data within the organization and categorize all data according to sensitivity level. This encompasses both on-premises and cloud-based data. It is impossible to protect sensitive data appropriately if you do not know what sensitive data you have on-premises and in cloud services. Once you…",

          "description": "A picture showing .NET\nWhat is .NET MAUI?\n.NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) is a cross-platform framework for creating native mobile and desktop apps with C# and XAML. Using .NET MAUI, you can develop apps that can run on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows from a single shared code-base.\nUsing .NET MAUI, you can create multi-platform apps using a single project, but you can add platform-specific source code and resources if necessary. One of the key aims of .NET MAUI is to enable you to implement as much of your app logic and UI layout as possible in a single code-base.\n \nIn this blog, we will cover how to Build a Water Consumption Mobile App using .NET MAUI that consumes historical data from a Web API. This solution is part of a project build for .NET Conf Student Zone 2022\n \nWhat will we be doing?\nBefore you can get started, we need a few things set up first:\n\nBuild a Mininal API from scratch to consume in your app\nBuild your first .NET MAUI App\nAdd a Consumption.cs class with the following propertiesA picture showing the Consumption.cs class\nAdd a APIManager.cs class to house the HTTP methods for your APIA picture showing the APIManager.cs class\n\nAfter the above are added, you can start to:\n\nConsume A Web API – this will show how you to consume the historical data stored in the Web API and display on your mobile app.\nSend data to your Web API using the HTTP Post Method (shown in the link above too).\n\n \nWe have a dedicated Microsoft learn module that will show you how to Consume and Send Data to your Web API. All of the code for this part of the project and other parts are available on the .NET Student Zone Githup Repositry\n \nTo see and understand the how to implement this in Visual Studio you can watch my session below.\n\nFinally, if you are curious about where the API data comes from, you can explore the other sessions of the .Net Student Conf and understand how all the different pieces and different technologies of .NET ecosystem are combined together into a single e-2-e project.",

In short terms, GitHub is known as the developer's best friend. \nAs software and technologies continue to evolve, also Github platform and services are constantly evolving. In this blog post, I wish to show you how the latest Git tools, GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Copilot, can transform and support the world of education.\n \nIn the following video, you'll be listening about two stories, whose scenarios will be familiar to anyone who is studying or teaching at University, or simply anyone who ever learned a new programming language/framework or prepared a hands-on workshop to deliver. \nThe first story's character is Ali, a Data Science teacher at the University of Nowhere. She is preparing for her spring semester course and in particular, she’s preparing a guided tutorial, with a full list of all the instructions her students will need to set up the environment for her Python lab.\nThe second story is about Mark. Mark is a student at University of Nowhere. He attended the Python data science lab by prof Ali and now he needs to complete the assignment at home. However, he gets stuck at some point.\n \nHow Github Codespaces and Github Copilot will help them and make their tasks easier? Watch the video below to find out the answer.\n\n\n\n \nUseful resources:\n\nLearn more about GitHub for Education and all the benefits for students and educators.\nExplore and build upon all the GitHub Codespaces templates for education.\nIf you missed GitHub Universe, read all the latest announcements. \nLearn more about Visual Studio Code and VS Code Extenstions which make it even easier to harness GitHub Codespaces.",

I really liked Python as a teaching language and as a first language for many students, due to its relatively low usage of punctuation and its tendency to read like an English sentence.\nHowever, as it is a text-based language, there are still many frustrating ways to mess up a Python program – spelling things wrong, indenting incorrectly, not using the right function for the job, etc. – and new programmers can have a particularly hard time understanding how to fix incorrect code. Teachers and TAs can help students decipher errors, but we’re not always around when they’re coding, especially in large classes (my class size ranged from 1000-2000!).\nThat’s why I’m ver…",

Developers who use TDD typically start developing by first writing a test that fails, and then writing the code that makes the test pass. This approach means that product code is more likely to get high test coverage, and the tests typically come first.\n \nMany developers find this pattern useful to help them prioritize good architecture from the start of development, and to stay laser-focused on each part of the functionality they need to implement. This school of thought advocates for testing not being an after-thought of development, but rather a driving force.\n \nFor example, in the following image, you can see that AddTest is written and fail…",

          "description": "Many work apps need the ability to schedule a meeting with others in their organization. Here's how to do it for apps connected to Microsoft 365.\n \nWork apps need work data\nWork apps serve a specific purpose: they help you track projects, follow orders or manage resources. But rarely do they contain all the information that users need to complete their work. Typically, information about people, their calendars, or communication is stored elsewhere, like in Microsoft 365. And that's a shame because completing a task requires users to switch between different apps, which is detrimental to their productivity. Unless of course, you bring work data into your work app.\n \nFind a meeting time and schedule a meeting on Microsoft 365\nA common scenario for work apps is to schedule a meeting with others in the organization. While it sounds trivial, the app must be able to access attendees' calendars, find a suitable meeting time and schedule the meeting. And that's where Microsoft Graph comes in.\n \nRecently I published an article on freeCodeCamp that shows you how to build an app connected to Microsoft 365 that can find a meeting time and schedule a meeting.\n \n\n \nThe app shows you how to make the best use of features available in the Microsoft Graph Toolkit and Microsoft Graph to build a UI that you could integrate with another app.\n \nWant to learn more joing our 30 days of Graph challenge runs from November 1-30, 2022. Watch  this short YouTube video to find out why you should participate! \n \nRegister for the 30 Days of Microsoft Graph Challenge today.\n \nCheck it out, and I'm looking forward to hearing what you think!",

And with toolkit's authentication providers, setting up auth is a matter of adding a few lines of code. Never again fiddle with setting up a login, handling access tokens, building web requests, and dealing with errors.\n \nLearn Microsoft Graph Toolkit interactively\nTo help you learn what Microsoft Graph Toolkit has to offer and how you'd use it in your app, we recently released a new learning path on Microsoft Learn. By following a few learn modules you'll learn everything that you need to know to use the toolkit in your app. But that's not all.\nThinking about the different ways in which people learn, we've launched an experiment - an interactive code tour that you can follow to add Microsoft Graph Toolkit to a React app.\n\n \n\n \nBy following the instructions in the tour, you gradually extend an empty React app with Microsoft Graph Toolkit turning it into a true Microsoft 365 app. What's cool about this code tour, is that it puts the code of your app in the center. Rather than reading long-form, you're in the code and get relevant, and in-place tips for building your app.\n \nThe Microsoft Graph Toolkit React code tour is a great way to quickly experience how you'd use the toolkit in a React app. We'd love it if you gave it a try and told us what you think. Shall we consider building tours for other technologies and scenarios?\n \nTry the Microsoft Graph Toolkit React code tour",

          "description": "If you're a web developer, there's an exciting opportunity for you to build applications for Microsoft 365, which many organizations across the world use for work. Let me show you, how you can use your existing skills and build your first application that integrates with Microsoft 365 in just 10 minutes.\n \nWhat's Microsoft 365?\nMicrosoft 365 is a set of applications, like Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Word, or SharePoint, that organizations use for work. Every day, millions of people use Microsoft 365 to chat, meet, send emails, create documents, and more.\n \nBut Microsoft 365 isn't just a set of apps. It's also a platform that enables developers, like yourself, to build applications. These apps can tap into data and insights stored on Microsoft 365 and bring them into people's workflows.\n \nBuilding for a platform\nBuilding for a platform isn't trivial. It comes with all kinds of specific knowledge you have to have like what tooling, SDKs, and APIs to use, how to integrate your app, and finally how to package and distribute it. What many people forget though, is that you don't have to learn everything about everything at once. Often, you can start simple and build up from there.\n \nBuild your first Microsoft 365 app in just 10 minutes\nRecently, I published an article on freeCodeCamp that shows you how you can build your first Microsoft 365 app in just 10 minutes.\n\n \n\n \nSure, the app is simple and doesn't do much, but when building it, you'll learn the fundamental concepts of building apps on Microsoft 365. And after these 10 minutes, you'll have a functional app that works and retrieves data from Microsoft 365, and which you can use as a starting point for more complex apps.\n \nGive it a try, and we're looking forward to hearing what you think.",

Organizations which are moving existing, on-premises deployments to the cloud at scale need purpose-built tooling that can help automate the process of analyzing their portfolio of applications for cloud readiness. To bridge that gap, we are excited to announce that Microsoft Azure has begun contributing to Red Hat’s Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA), a tool that supports large-scale Java application modernization and migration projects across a broad range of transformations and use cases by automating source-code analysis and providing line-by-line recommendations to migrate your applications to new Java runtimes or the Azure cloud. These contributions to the Red Hat MTA provide service-specific migration recommendations for Azure App Service.\n \n\n \nThe collaboration adds rulesets to the open source upstream of the MTA, known as Windup. These new rules search for some common scenarios and provide guidance for accomplishing the task in Azure:\n\nConfiguring data sources\nJava Key Store usage for certificates\nUsing Maven to deploy to App Service\nProper use of the file system in Azure\nUsing Azure Service Bus for JMS\nUsing Azure Active Directory as an identity provider\n… and more!\n\n \nCheck out this Video Demo for more information.\n \nYou can download the web or CLI client of the Migration Toolkit for Applications from the Red Hat’s website or install it as a VS Code plugin.\n \nHave questions or comments?

Create a new Web app for Windows using any available Runtime stack for Windows.\n\n \n2. After the creation complete, go to Kudu site from Azure Portal:\n\n \n3. Create a new directory and download the PHP runtime(Non Thread Safe Version) from PHP For Windows: Binaries and sources Releases and extract it, in this demo, we use php 8.2.1, the output is as below:\n \n \nmkdir php\ncurl https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.2.1-nts-Win32-vs16-x64.zip -o php\\php.zip\ncd php\nunzip php.zip\n \n \n\n\n \n4.

To support this, we have increased the number of nodes you can have in a single Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster from 1,000 to 5,000.  This will allow you to reduce the number of clusters needed to run your workloads, reducing the operational overhead needed to support application teams.\n \nWhen using the uptime SLA you can request a quota increase across all node pools in the cluster by raising a support request.  \n \nNetworking at scale\n \nOne of the things we hear a lot from our customers is around IP address exhaustion.  The release of Dynamic IP allocation has helped to reduce the need to pre-allocate IP…",

With the release of Nuxt 3’s release candidate in April 2022, developers witnessed a complete re-architect of the framework. Nuxt 2 apps that have been upgraded with Nuxt Bridge also work with Azure Static Web Apps.\n \nWhat’s new in Nuxt 3? \n \n\nZero-configuration deployment of Nuxt 3 and Nuxt Bridge applications with universal rendering to Azure Static Web Apps \nAPI routes support for automatic generation from server API and middleware directories \nVue 3 support including composition API with imported functions for better code re-usability \nNitro Engine, a full stack server that allows deployment of output on Node.js, serverless, edge-side rendering, or as static \nVite, a frontend tooling that features fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimizes assets for production \n\nUniversal rendering vs static rendering\n \nPreviously, you were able to deploy a static rendered Nuxt app on Azure Static Web Apps, where the entire app is pre-generated as static content. However, Nuxt 3 also supports universal rendering, which provides the performance and search engine optimization of server-side rendering while still enabling client-side interactivity.\n \nWith Nuxt 3's support for Azure Static Web Apps, you can now deploy sites with universal rendering. \n \nTo learn more, check out the Nuxt 3 site deployment with universal rendering on Azure Static Web Apps documentation that also includes a tutorial.\n \nNuxt 3 Sample App on Azure Static Web Apps\n \nNuzhat Minhaz is a Program Manager Intern on the Azure Static Web App team at Microsoft.

Rather using coarser-grained time based retention, you can use event key-based retention mechanism where Event Hubs retrains the last known value for each event key of an event hub or a Kafka topic. \n \nLog compaction can be useful in scenarios where you stream the same set of updatable eve…",

          "description": "Today we are announcing the availability of 220+ SAP S/4HANA events on Azure. A homologous announcement from SAP is found here.\n \nMany companies rely on SAP S/4HANA and an assortment of custom applications, SaaS services, or other commercial solutions to run their business functions. Given this diverse deployment topology, they require their SAP S/4HANA applications to work together with other applications that run on Azure.  A way to achieve this is by integrating both systems using an event-driven approach. You can now configure your SAP Event Mesh (SAP’s event broker) to send SAP events to Azure Event Grid more easily than current alternative approaches. This way, your applications on Azure can react to system state changes that originate in an SAP backend application. This approach avo…",

          "description": "Communication between a client application and an Azure Service Bus namespace is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS is a standard cryptographic protocol that ensures privacy and data integrity between clients and services over the Internet. For more information about TLS, see Transport Layer Security.\n \nAzure Service Bus supports choosing a specific TLS version for namespaces. Currently Azure Service Bus uses TLS 1.2 on public endpoints by default, but TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are still supported for backward compatibility.\n \nAzure Service Bus namespaces permit clients to send and receive data with TLS 1.0 and above. To enforce stricter security measures, you can configure your Service Bus namespace to require that clients send and receive data with a newer version of TLS. If a Service Bus namespace requires a minimum version of TLS, then any requests made with an older version will fail. \n \nThanks to your input and feedback, this feature is now in general availability.\n \n\n \nTo learn more, see Enforce a minimum required version of Transport Layer Security (TLS) for requests to a Service Bus namespace.",

We're going to talk about the relationship between architecture and ambiguity. What do you do when the specs aren't entirely clear, or the plans aren't entirely clear? What people need isn't entirely clear? We're going to discuss that with our architects.\n \nIt's not uncommon for people to come to architects with very vague statements or questions that aren't really precise. Or a problem needs to be solved, but it's not really clear what that problem is.\n \n \nWhat can architects do to help with ambiguity?\n \nDepending on the depth of your experience, you have to get more comfortable with ambiguity.

Simply put, it exposes your Azure VMware Solution resources (VMs, networks, datastores, etc.) to the Azure portal.\n \nUsing Arc for Azure VMware Solution, those resources can be managed via the Azure portal, even though they are within your vSphere cluster running in an Azure datacenter. Even better, there is no cost to deploy Arc for Azure VMware Solution. More blogs to come on Arc for Azure VMware Solution, but if you want to get some more details check out this video from Jeremiah Megie.\n \nFirst things first. Let’s get Arc for Azure VMware Solution installed into your private cloud.\nYou will need to collect the following information to input into the PowerShell script, which, if you use it, will make the deployment a bit more straightforward.\n \n\nSubscription ID and Resource Group where the Azure VMware Solution private cloud is deployed.\n Name of the Azure VMware Solution private cloud.\n /28 network segment for the ARC appliance.\n\n\nThe/28 network segment will be an NSX-T segment in the private cloud. Under the covers, the deployment script creates NSX-T segment for use by the ARC appliances. The value must be entered into the script as the gateway to the segment, followed by /28. For example, if 192.168.99.1/28 is entered, there will be a /28 NSX-T segment created with the gateway 192.168.99.1.\n \nThe other information you can get from the Overview blade of your private cloud.\n \n\n \nRequirements\n\nYour private cloud must have Internet access.\nAlso, because of the appliance size, ideally you would want to run this script as close to the private cloud, or from a machine inside the AVS Private Cloud.\n\nThe script can be found here;\nhttps://virtualworkloads.com/2023/02/deploy-arc-for-azure-vmware-solution-simply-using-powershell/#script",

          "description": "Over the last few years, we’ve received extensive feedback around the need for a better custom logs experience in Azure Monitor Logs. To address it, the team stepped back, analyzed needs in the space, and rebuilt from the ground-up the full custom logs feature set. The features have been in preview for several months now, being vetted by many Log Analytics customers including some of the largest retailers, banks, and healthcare providers in the world. With preview feedback addressed and services now fully scaled out to meet the complex needs of these users and more, we are today excited to announce the revamped custom logs features are now generally available!\n \nToday, we are announcing the following:\n\nGA of the Log Ingestion API. This secure, scalable, and flexible API is the path going forward for all custom data ingestion needs.\nGA of the Ingestion-time Transformations feature. This feature allows users to customize built-in data streams to parse, enrich, filter, or otherwise tailor incoming data to their specific use-cases.\nA pricing for data sent to the system and subsequently dropped in a transformation. A nominal fee per GB dropped will be charged for any data dropped beyond 50% of incoming data, calculated daily. The fee is waived for Azure Sentinel-enabled workspaces. While we're announcing billing today, we will not start charging yet as of this announcement, and will provide at least a 3-month notice before doing so. The Azure Monitor pricing page will be imminently updated with these details.\n\n \nScreenshot of ingestion-time transformation UI\n \n \n \nFor those of you who participated in our preview - thank you for your feedback, and to those new to the features - we're excited for you to start using them! To learn more, please start with our docs, and don’t hesitate to reach out should you have any questions!",

          "description": "Java Profiler for Azure Monitor Application Insights is now in Public Preview. It is a new capability in Azure Monitor to help Java developers troubleshoot performance issues and uncover performance bottlenecks. \n  \nUnder the hood, it uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to profile your application using a customized configuration.  For additional context, JFR is a tool that collects profiling data of running Java applications, and it is integrated into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). JFR comes with little to barely noticeable overhead cost which makes it great to run on heavily loaded production deployments. \n  \nUsing the customized configuration, you can generate profiles in two ways: \n  \n\nAutomated Profiling - Configure CPU and memory thresholds to automatically trigger a profile recording. \nOn-demand Profiling - Use “Profile Now” to run near real-time profile recording. \n\n To try out the Java Profiler:\n \n\nEnable Azure Monitor Application Insights using v3.4.1 jar file or later. \nEnable the profiler using the java profiler installation guidance and set your CPU/Memory triggers for automatic profiling. \nClick the \"Profiler\" button on the Application Insights Performance Blade and click \"Profile Now\" for an on-demand profile. \nDownload the profiling session when it becomes available (it may take about 5 minutes to show up in Portal). \nView and analyze the profile with Java Mission Control (JMC) or another tool (java profiles are not currently viewable in Portal). \n\n  \n\n \n  \nJava Profiling is in preview today and can be enabled across all your JVMs. Even better, it is included in Application Insights for no additional cost. Try it out and let us know what you think!",
