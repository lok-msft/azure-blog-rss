This version will be shipped with Spring Boot 3.0.0-M5 due for release later this week.\n\r\nSpring Boot 3.0 is around the corner and the community is expecting a compatible Spring for GraphQL version to go with it. Currently, the best way to prepare for the Spring Boot 3.0 upgrade is to upgrade to Spring Boot 2.7 and Java 17, but Spring Boot 3.0 has new baseline requirements, namely Java 17, Jakarta APIs and Spring Framework 6.0.\n\r\nGiven that Spring for GraphQL 1.0.0 was released towards the end of May this year, we didn’t feel we would have enough time nor feedback to go with a major release of the project for Boot 3.0. This is why the goal of the 1.1 release is simply to adapt to the new baseline requirements and provide a smooth upgrade to Spring Boot 3.0 for existing projects.\n\r\nThis first milestone brings those foundational changes: the Java 17, Jakarta APIs, and a Spring Framework 6.0 baseline. We’re also taking the opportunity to upgrade to GraphQL Java 19.x – a painless upgrade on our side, thanks to the GraphQL Java team! We’ve also replaced our internally developed context propagation mechanism with the new Micrometer Context Propagation library, that’s intended for use broadly across Spring projects. It allows Spring applications to propagate context across various such mechanisms, e.g. ThreadLocal, Reactor Context, GraphQLContext, and others.\n\r\nIn the next milestones, we will consider how we can adapt our current arrangement with important themes in Spring Boot 3.0: GraalVM native image and Micrometer Observability support. Given the short timeline, we might schedule some changes for a future version – again, a smooth upgrade is our top priority here.\nHow can you help?\n\r\nIf you have general questions, please ask on stackoverflow.com using the spring-graphql tag.\n\r\nProject Page | GitHub | Issues | Documentation | Stack Overflow",

          "description": "It has been almost 4 years since the last set of Spring Web Flow releases. Nevertheless, the project continues to serve a specific need particularly well, arguably better than alternatives, and remains in active use. While there hasn’t been a strong driver for new releases, the upcoming Spring Framework 6 brings a Java 17 baseline and makes the shift to Jakarta EE, which creates the need for such a release in order to enable applications to migrate to this new baseline.\n\r\nToday I’m pleased to announce the availability of Spring Web Flow 3.0 M1 in the Spring milestone repository. This release focuses mainly on compatibility with Spring Framework 6 and Jakarta EE. The Travel booking-mvc sample on spring-projects/spring-webflow-samples has been updated and the commit history provides example changes. One significant change is the need to remove Tiles which has not migrated to Jakarta EE. In the sample, Thymeleaf Layouts is used instead.\n\r\nNote that Spring Faces is not included in the release due to its deep integration with JSF and the additional time and effort required to migrate. Please, reach out if you have experience with Web Flow and JSF and are interested to help out with the migration of Spring Faces to Spring Framework 6 and Jakarta EE.\n\r\nIf you have a Web Flow application and you plan to migrate to Spring Framework 6, please give this milestone a try and provide feedback through the project issue tracker. Special thanks to Ian Young and Scott Cantor for their substantial contributions to this release!",

          "description": "Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! How are you? This week I’m writing you from sunny Seattle, Washington, where we’re having our next installment of the SpringOne Tour series. It’s been a ton of fun seeing all these fun and friendly faces again and getting to see people, many of whom I haven’t seen since before the pandemic! I’ve also had a lot of fun seeing some friends from some of the big cloud companies here, Microsoft and AWS. It’s always interesting to learn how people are using the latest and greatest from Spring to build amazing systems and software targeting these cloud platforms.\n\r\nWe’ve got a lot to cover this week so let’s dive right into it!\n\r\n\r\n  \nIn last week’s podcast, I talked to Kubernetes contributor and fellow Tanzu Developer Advocate Leigh Capili\n\r\n  \nDistributed Tracing With OpenTelemetry, Spring Cloud Sleuth, Kafka, and Jaeger\n\r\n  \nIngress vs. Load Balancer in Kubernetes\n\r\n  \nInstantiating Multiple Beans of the Same Class with Spring Annotations\n\r\n  \nCurious about when and why to use Java 14 Records vs. Lombok? Check out this article\n\r\n  \nI put together this little example , thanks to Reactor lead Simon Baslé, showing how to handle pagination with the expand operator in Project Reactor: Pagination in a Reactive Application. It looks at how to eleganrly expand the contents of a reactive stream as new data (in a data pagination scenario) becomes available.\n\r\n  \nSpring Shell 2.1.0-RC1 is now available\n\r\n  \nPushing a Docker Image to a Self-Hosted Registry\n\r\n  \nSpring for Apache Kafka 2.9 Release Candidate Available\n\r\n  \nThis Apache Maven Survival Guide is quite interesting, to me at least!",

I only just realized it was Tuesday! And you know what that means?

          "description": "Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! How are you? It’s been a hot minute since we last chatted. I was in Germany this time last week. Now, I’m back in beautiful San Francisco. Today the weather will climb to a monumental 84 F! That’s very unusual, for any time of the year, here in San Francisco. Most places here in San Francisco don’t have air conditioning. Some have heating. I bought a brand new condo in 2014 and it didn’t have air conditioning. You just open the window. I am privileged enough that I have air conditioning today, of course. I mention all this to say that it’s hot here! I worry for the elderly! When it gets this hot, the YMCA and other organizations typically invite elderly people to come in and get some cool air and water. It’s dangerous. Some days it gets even hotter. Very rare, but it does happen. I hope you’re all doing well. Take care of yourselves and each other, my friends. \n\r\nAnd, speaking of being hot, let’s look at this week’s roundup of the latest-and-greatest that’s hot off the press! \n\r\n\r\n  \nBootiful Podcast: Spring Framework contributor Sébastien Deleuze on GraalVM, AOT, project Leyden, and WebAssembly\n\r\n  \nCVE report published for Spring Cloud Function\n\r\n  \nDebugging Collections, Streams and Watch Renderers\n\r\n  \nDifference Between Flux.create and Flux.generate\n\r\n  \nHandle Spring Security Exceptions With @ExceptionHandler\n\r\n  \nMongoDB Composite Key With Spring Data\n\r\n  \nSpring Authorization Server 0.3.1 available now\n\r\n  \nMonitoring Spring Boot applications using Spring Boot Admin\n\r\n  \nSpring Data 2021.2.1 and 2021.1.5 released\n\r\n  \nSpring Data JPA – Run an App Without a Database\n\r\n  \nSpring Data MongoDB SpEL Expression Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2022-22980)\n\r\n  \nSpring Framework 5.3.21 available now\n\r\n  \nSpring Security 5.7.2 and 5.6.6 available now\n\r\n  \nSpring Tools 4.15.0 released\n\r\n  \nSpring Tools 4.15.1 released\n\r\n  \nWhat are the Spring Boot Default Memory Settings?\n\r\n  \nA Guide to Docker Private Registry\n\r\n  \nIs There a Destructor in Java?",

In a previous post, we introduced the isolated process model, which decouples your function code from the core Azure Functions host, in contrast to the traditional model where we run them together in the same process. Functions V4 supports .NET 6 in both models, and the isolated process model also supports .NET 7 (public preview) and Framework 4.8 (public preview). In this update, we’ll re-cap some of our recent updates, outline some changes to look forward to, and expand on our thinking about future versions.\n \nWe will provide another roadmap update in early 2023.\n \nRecent updates\nOne of the strengths of the isolated process…",

I'm happy with the results so far even though some of it took quite the effort to pull off.\n \nThe EasyAuth login process was pretty much as far as we got regarding the user facing side of things as most of the work was behind the scenes making the infra work without the use of passwords and client secrets.

As developers, we need the flexibility to set up and maintain our workstation, but even ‘small changes’ can unexpectedly poison our dev environments, interrupting our flow and costing hours to undo.\nAt the same time, many IT organizations are struggling to provide dev teams with the flexibility they need to stay productive. Hardware requirements for developer workstations can change rapidly as projects evolve, and an increase in hybrid development teams means it’s more difficult than ever to get developers the resources they need.\nToday, we are excited to announce Microsoft Dev Box, a new cloud service that provides developers with secure,…",

It’s open source and is not tied to any processing framework, data model or programming language. Parquet is ideal for storing any kind of big data and is built to support efficient compression and encoding schemes.  \n \nCapture streaming data in Parquet format using Event Hubs\nUsing Azure Event Hubs, no code editor for event processing, you can automatically capture streaming data in an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account in Parquet format. The no code editor allows you to easily develop an Azure Stream Analytics job without writing a single line of code.\n \n\nOnce data is captured, any analytics service of your choice can process or analyze Parquet data. \n \nGet Started Today\nYou can try out Apache Parquet capturing feature in Azure Event Hubs using the following links.\n\nTo try out Parquet capturing feature, follow Capture data from Event Hubs in Parquet format.\nYou can follow the tutorial on Capture Event Hubs data in Parquet format and analyze with Azure Synapse Analytics. \nTo learn more about no code editor in Event Hubs for event stream processing, check out No code stream processing using Azure Stream Analytics (Preview).",

          "description": "Background  \nThe Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a management platform that you can use to manage your IT and development infrastructure with configuration as code. The Azure Desired State Configuration (DSC) extension helps bootstrap a VM to the Azure Automation State Configuration (DSC) service. The DSC extension can be installed on Azure VMs as a Virtual Machine Extension.  The DSCForLinux extension installs the OMI and DSC agent on Azure virtual machines.  \n  \nOver the past year, our team has been developing Automatic Extension Upgrade which now supports the DSC extension. When Automatic Extension Upgrade for the DSC extension is enabled on a VM, the extension is upgraded automatically whenever Microsoft releases a new version for the extension. You can do this by simply setting the flag to true via API, CLI or PowerShell as documented here.  \n   \nSecurity Recommendations  \nWe strongly recommend enabling automatic updates for the DSC extension as soon as possible. This update ensures that customers get important security or performance updates to the extension as soon as possible without manual overhead.  \n   \nAs always, we welcome feedback from customers and partners which supports our efforts to continuously harden our products and services. We want to thank the Wiz team for their collaboration and commitment to helping make Azure customers more secure.",

This past year, we have been working to support customers more holistically, shipping the public preview of  “Apply and Monitor” and “Apply and Autocorrect” assignment types, and are working hard on the upcoming GA of these capabilities.\n \nWe have been listening to our customers as well as the community and are excited to announce a name that highlights the current and future capabilities of our service. Guest configuration will become machine configuration. In addition to the name change, we are moving under the Automanage brand umbrella to reinforce the message that the goal of machine configuration is to reduce op-ex and customer burden in managing their Windows and Linux machines both in Azure and on-premises. It is important to note that the current experience within policy will not change. Customers will still be able to apply machine configurations at scale through policy assignments as they have thus far. \n \nThis rebranding will go live soon in the Azure portal as well as our documentation.

You can configure particular tables to use Basic Logs. The list of tables that are applicable to Basic plan can be found here. You can read here about the differences between Analytics and Basic Logs plans.\nConfigure the retention and archive duration in Data retention settings section.By default, all tables in your workspace inherit the workspace retention and have no archive. From the Data retention settings section you can set the retention policies for individual tables: Interactive retention and Total retention, and the Archive retention value is calculated as (Total – Interactive).\nNote: \nSelecting a longer retention period will incur additional charges.
