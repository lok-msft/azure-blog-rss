If you are working with many App Service plans, managing the subnets can be an unnecessary administrative task. Therefore, I am happy to announce that we are introducing Multi-plan subnet join (MPSJ) in limited public preview at Ignite 2023.\n \nMPSJ reduces subnet sprawl when dealing with many apps across many plans and simplifies management of networking control such as Network Security Groups and Route tables across App Service plans. With MPSJ you can join a virtual network/subnet in a different subscription, but all App Service plan joining a specific subnet must be in the same subscription.\n \nYou may still want to use individual subnets if you plan to differentiate on Network Security…",

Instead of manually configuring the database each time you deploy your application, you can use an Init Container to handle this task. The Init Container can run scripts to create tables, seed initial data, or set up the database schema. Once the database is ready, the main application container can safely start, knowing that the required database structure is in place.\n \nThe below example defines an init container which runs under the same pod as main app container, seeds data to an existing Azure MySQL Database which will be used by the main web app container to serve contents onto the landing page.\n \n\n \nThe init container inserts a record into an existing table named myguests in Azure My SQL DB using a python script. The script contains code for connecting to the Database alongside inserting record into the Database. This data will then be retrieved and used by the main app container which is also running a python Flask based web application and return the value in the landing page.\n \nDockerfile for Init Container\n \n \n \nFROM python\nCOPY . .\nRUN pip install mysql && pip install mysql-connector-python\nCMD [\"python\", \"test.py\"]\n\n \n \n \n \nPython Script for Init Container\n \n \n \nimport mysql.connector\n\nmydb = mysql.connector.connect(\n  host=\"init-test.mysql.database.azure.com\",\n  user=\"*******\",\n  password=\"*******\",\n  database=\"*****\"\n)\n\nmycursor = mydb.cursor()\n\nsql = \"INSERT INTO myguests (firstname, lastname, email) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'test@outlook.com')\"\n\nmycursor.execute(sql)\n\nmydb.commit()\n\nprint(mycursor.rowcount, \"record(s) affected\")\n\n \n \n \n \nOutput from Init Container\n \n\n \n \n \nDockerfile for main app container\n \n \n \nFROM python\nCOPY . .\nRUN pip install mysql-connector && pip install flask\nEXPOSE 5000\nCMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]\n \n \n \nOutput",

Yep, you guessed it – automating it with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using Azure Pipelines and Azure Load Testing.\n \nWhy automate load tests with CI/CD?\nBefore we jump into the nitty-gritty, let's understand why automating load tests with CI/CD is a game-changer:\n\nDetect issues early: By integrating load tests into your CI/CD pipeline, you can detect performance issues early . Address problems before they reach production, reducing the impact on end-users.\nCon…",

          "description": "In some scenarios, you might need to preprocess files before they're used by your application. For instance, you're deploying a machine learning model that relies on precomputed data files. An Init Container can download, extract, or preprocess these files, ensuring they are ready for the main application container. This approach simplifies the deployment process and ensures that your application always has access to the required data.\n \nThe below example defines a simple Pod that has an init container which downloads a file from some resource to a file share which is shared between the init and main app container. The main app container is running a php-apache image and serves the landing page using the index.php file downloaded into the shared file space.\n \n\n \nThe init container mounts the shared volume at /mydir , and the main application container mounts the shared volume at /var/www/html. The init container runs the following command to download the file and then terminates: wget -O /mydir/index.php http://info.cern.ch. \n \nConfigurations and dockerfile for init container:\n \n\nMount the storage file share on the environment level\nCreate init container with mounting file share named init on path /mydir:\n\n\n \n \n\nDockerfile for init which downloads an index.php file under /mydir:\n\n \nFROM busybox:1.28 \nWORKDIR / \nENTRYPOINT [\"wget\", \"-O\", \"/mydir/index.php\", \"http://info.cern.ch\"]\n \n \n \nConfiguration for main app container:\n \n\nCreate main app container mounting file share named init on path /var/www/html:\n\n\n \n \n\nMain app container configuration which uses php-apache image and serves the index.php file from DocumentRoot /var/www/html:\n\n\n \nOutput:\n \n\n \n \n \nLogs:",

          "description": "A Java dependency version conflict occurs when two or more dependencies in your project have incompatible versions of the same class or resource. This can cause runtime errors, unexpected behavior, or compilation failures in your Java application. Sometimes it is hard to detect them, while with the help of IDEA Maven Helper, it has never been so simple.\n \n1. Install the plugin\nIn IntelliJ IDEA, choose File -> Settings -> Plugins. Within the Marketplace tab, search for Maven Helper and click Install.\n\n \n2. Leverage the plugin\nOpen the pom.xml file of your project and switch to the Dependency Analyzer tab at the bottom.\n\nYou will see three options: Conflicts, All Dependencies as List, and All Dependencies as Tree. Choose Conflicts to see if there are any dependency conflicts in your project.\n\n \n3. Resolve conflict\nTo resolve a conflict, you can right-click on a dependency on the left panel and choose Exclude. This will add an exclusion tag to your pom.xml file and remove the dependency from your project. Alternatively, you can also choose a compatible version of the dependency that works with all other dependencies and declare it explicitly in your pom.xml file using the dependencyManagement section.\nAfter resolving a conflict, you can refresh the Dependency Analyzer tab to see if there are any remaining conflicts. You can also use the All Dependencies as List or All Dependencies as Tree options to see all the dependencies in your project in different formats.\n\n \n4. Conclusion\nDependency conflicts can be difficult to detect, but they can cause a lot of problems in the project. By using the above-mentioned technique and following best practices to prevent dependency conflicts, you can ensure your application runs smoothly without any issues.\nReferences:Troubleshoot dependency version conflicts when using the Azure SDK for Java | Microsoft Learn Maven – Introduction to the Dependency Mechanism (apache.org)",

However, if the client only supports weak cipher suites, then the front-end’s OS would pick a weak cipher suite that they both support.\nApp Service does SSL termination on the Frontend layer, which happens before the frontend instances forward requests to workers.

          "description": "There are multiple ways to increase the concurrency of python function app. I drew an architecture diagram, which can give us an overall understanding of the function app.\n \n\nBased on the diagram, we can see we could increase function app concurrency by increasing instance count, python worker count and thread count. To better understand this, I build several labs to validate this. I will not demonstrate instance count as it is easy to understand. All these labs are having 4 concurrent incoming requests and each request takes 10 seconds to complete.\n \nLab1:\ncode:\nsync\n\nConfiguration:\nmaxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=1\nResult:\nIt took 40 seconds to complete the 4 executions. We can see these 4 executions were triggered at the same time, this is because the function host level is using async. But actually these executions are executed one by one.\n\nLab2:\ncode: The same as Lab1.\nConfiguration:\nmaxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=2\nResult:\nIt took 20 seconds to complete the 4 executions.\n\n \nLab3:\ncode: The same as Lab1.\nConfiguration:\nmaxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=2PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=2\nResult:\nIt took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.\n\nLab4:\ncode:\nasync\n\nConfiguration:\nmaxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=1\nResult:\nIt took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.\n\n \nConclusion:\n1.We can increase the concurrency by increasing FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT and PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT. Just note that we can configure the concurrent setting in host.json file. This is the bottleneck of the concurrency. \n2.It is more recommended to use async method instead of sync method as async has better performance than sync with the same configuration.\n \nReference link:\nAzure Functions HTTP triggers and bindings | Microsoft Learn\nImprove throughput performance of Python apps in Azure Functions | Microsoft Learn",

          "description": "As a PHP developer, sometimes you might want to set the custom configuration file (.ini) to read when PHP starts up. For this article, I would like demonstrate how to load custom configuration file (.ini) in the Azure App Service.\n \nBy default, we set the PHP_INI_DIR = /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d, so when using SSH on Kudu, you could see there are lots of .ini files:\n\n \nBased on this, you might think we could just manually add our custom .ini files in /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d, but it will not work after restart. Since only \"/home\" data will be persistent after restarting App Service. So what we need to do is to add our .ini in \"/home\", E.g. \"/home/site/ini\"\n \nFor example, if I would like to modify \"upload_max_filesize to 64M (defualt is 2M) and post_max_size to 64M (default is 8M)\" for the PHP website, I could follow the below steps to achieve it:\n \nStep 1:\nUse like vi/vim command to add setting.ini file in the \"/home/site/ini\" folder\n\n \nStep 2:\nPHP supports scanning multiple directories for .ini files. For this we need to set PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR with \":\" to separate values on the Application Setting for the target App Service.\nE.g. PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR = :/home/site/ini\nThis ensures that we load *.ini files from  /usr/local/etc/php and then load from /home/site/ini\n\n \n \nAfter, we check the value by simple php page and it will show upload_max_size and post_max_size are set as 64M now.\n\n \nReference:\n\nUnderstanding the Azure App Service file system: Understanding the Azure App Service file system · projectkudu/kudu Wiki · GitHub\nConfigure a PHP app for Azure App Service: Configure PHP apps - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn",

          "description": "Azure Static Web App offers two types of preview environments: branch environment and named environment. Both of these methods offer isolated environments for testing and deploying changes to your Azure Static Web App, allowing you to test and validate changes without affecting the main production environment.\n \nHere are the steps to create a preview environment:\n \n1. After deploying the production branch to the main site, create a new branch based on the main branch and name it \"dev\".\n\n\n \n2. Modify your YAML file in the dev branch to include \"dev\" in the trigger to track any changes in the dev branch.\n\n \n3. Set \"production_branch\" to the name of your production branch. This action will ensure the deploy task in the dev branch creates a new preview environment.\n\n \n4. Save the changes and after deployment, you can see a new environment named 'dev' for the dev branch.\n\n \n5. If you want to name a preview environment separately (instead of using the branch name), set the \"deployment_environment\" to the desired name, and it will create a named environment.\n\n \n\n \nThe main difference between branch and named environments is that branch environments are created automatically based on the branch name, whereas named environments are custom-named. \n \nOverall, both branch and named environments provide isolated environments for testing and deploying changes to your Azure Static Web App, allowing you to test and validate changes without affecting the main production environment.

KMS provides an interface for a provider to utilize a key stored in an external key service to perform this encryption. While KMS v1 on AKS enabled the encryption of Kubernetes secrets using a key in Azure Key Vault, it was limited to only supporting encryption of 2000 secrets. To address this limitation, the Azure Container Upstream team, in collaboration with the Kubernetes community, spearheaded the enhancement project. After being part of two Kubernetes releases, this feature has graduated to beta in Kubernetes v1.27. As soon as KMS v2 became beta in v1.27, Microsoft promptly made it available on AKS as one of many security enhancement features available to its users. For a full list of KMSv2 enhancements, check out this Kubernetes blog post.\nFor clusters at version v1.27+ with KMS newly enabled, KMS v2 is configured by default. However, for clusters with KMS enabled at versions below v1.27, upgrading to v1.27 will be blocked . To upgrade, follow the steps outlined in this documentation for migrating from KMS v1 to v2, and then proceed with upgrading the cluster to version v1.27. Running your v1.27 AKS cluster with KMS v2 feature enabled, you can now encrypt more than 2000 secrets.",

The difficulty is that Git support for Fabric at this time is limited, and there are no ARM templates to deploy in like there is in Azure.\n \nTo meet these requests, I have created step-by-step instructions for these 2 patterns in our Analytics in a Box GitHub Repo. While you will be able to upload the Spark Notebooks as well as upload and run the SQL scripts used in this solution, you will follow the instructions for creating the pipelines and pipeline activities. I have tried to facilitate this by providing you with all the configurations for each pipeline and activity that you can cut and paste into each pipeline or activity setting. While this may be a bit of a laborious effort, I believe you will actually learn more about building Metadata Driven Fabric Pipelines then if you truly could just deploy from out of the box.\n \nIf you're not quite ready for SaaS for your data analytics, check out the available patterns for Synapse in the same GitHub repo!",

          "description": "What is Grounding?\nGrounding is the process of using large language models (LLMs) with information that is use-case specific, relevant, and not available as part of the LLM's trained knowledge. It is crucial for ensuring the quality, accuracy, and relevance of the generated output. While LLMs come with a vast amount of knowledge already, this knowledge is limited and not tailored to specific use-cases. To obtain accurate and relevant output, we must provide LLMs with the necessary information. In other words, we need to \"ground\" the models in the context of our specific use-case.\n \nMotivation for Grounding\nThe primary motivation for grounding is that LLMs are not databases, even if they possess a wealth of knowledge. They are designed to be used as general reasoning and text engines. LLMs …",

As a first step, this service is fully integrated with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as an add-on which scrapes Prometheus metrics.\n \nTo integrate KEDA into your Azure Kubernetes Service, you will need to deploy and configure a workload identity or pod identity on your cluster. This identity allows KEDA to authenticate with Azure and retrieve metrics for scaling from your Monitor workspace.\n \nWe recommend using Azure Active Directory workload identity. This authentication method replaces pod-managed identity (pod-managed identity in AKS has been deprecated as of 10/24/2022), which integrates with the Kubernetes native capabilities to federate with any external identity providers on behalf of the application.\n \nAzure Managed Prometheus support starts from KEDA v2.10. If you have an older version of KEDA installed, you must upgrade in order to work with Azure Managed Prometheus.\n \nTo integrate KEDA into your AKS, please start with our documentation, and reach out to us should you have any feedback or questions!",

With the introduction of Deny Action, policy enforcement now expands into blocking request based on actions to the resource. These deny action policy assignments can safeguard critical infrastructure by blocking unwarranted delete calls.  \n \nAzure Policy expands its at-scale enforcement capabilities to assess requests based on action. Previously, Policy only supported the ‘deny’ effect which blocks requests based on resource configurations or properties. Now a newly added effect, Deny Action, extends that functionality to block based on intended request.  \n \nDeny Action effect can be leveraged in the existing policy definitions schema. This allows for the conditional flexibility that comes with the “If” structure of a policy definition. Further, by assigning these definitions at subscription or management group level, deny action can help block these actions at-scale.

As a first step, this service is fully integrated with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as an add-on which scrapes Prometheus metrics.\n \nTo integrate KEDA into your Azure Kubernetes Service, you will need to deploy and configure a workload identity or pod identity on your cluster. This identity allows KEDA to authenticate with Azure and retrieve metrics for scaling from your Monitor workspace.\n \nWe recommend using Azure Active Directory workload identity. This authentication method replaces pod-managed identity (pod-managed identity in AKS has been deprecated as of 10/24/2022), which integrates with the Kubernetes native capabilities to federate with any external identity providers on behalf of the application.\n \nAzure Managed Prometheus support starts from KEDA v2.10. If you have an older version of KEDA installed, you must upgrade in order to work with Azure Managed Prometheus.\n \nTo integrate KEDA into your AKS, please start with our documentation, and reach out to us should you have any feedback or questions!",
