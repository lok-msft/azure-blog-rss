Starting with version 1.1.x of Spring Cloud Stream until 3.0.0, we provided a schema registry server and AVRO-based schema registry client converters that can reconcile the schema from the schema registry server. Spring Cloud Stream version 3.0.0 moved the Schema Registry components into a top-level spring-cloud project, and Spring Cloud Stream included those in its BOM for the end user applications to consume them. However, this didn’t scale well, and with the 3.2 version, we decided to stop having them as part of the Spring Cloud Stream BOM. \n\r\nThe schema registry use ca…",

It’s Sunday the 16th of October as I write this and I’m winging my way to sunny Las Vegas, Nevada, where I’ll be attending (and presenting at) the first JavaOne show in years! It didn’t exist as the JavaOne we know and love for years, even before the pandemic interrupted life as we know it worldwide. So this isn’t just the first JavaOne since 2019, it’s [the first JavaOne since 2017](https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/04/oracle-kills-java-one/_!

          "description": "Hi, Spring fans! I was just at Devoxx in Belgium, where hundreds of experts from across the Java ecosystem converged for the first time since 2019 to deliver their biggest and best. \n\r\nI could do a proper trip report, but I really just came here to point you to two talks from two of my amazing teammates, Stéphane Nicoll (@snicoll) and Brian Clozel (@bclozel), who have been very hard at work on both Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, both of which will land by the end of November, 2022. These are brand new generations of the framework, implying huge new paradigms and new opportunities for developers. \n\r\nThis first is a broader, whirlwind tour of the new features in Spring Framework 6 (which bubble up into Spring Boot 3).\n\r\n\r\nThis second one introduces the new ahead-of-time (AOT) support in Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, which makes it trivial to build GraalVM native images.\n\r\n\n\r\nNB: please ignore the metadata for the YouTube videos. Both talks feature both speakers, and there is no mention whatsoever of React and JavaScript and the like. I think that was a metadata issue with the publication of the videos on YouTube, which will hopefully be resolved. \n\r\nEnjoy! \n\r\nIf you missed this event, that’s OK - there’s still time to join the Spring team and larger Java ecosystem for SpringOne, being held 6-8 December, 2022, in sunny San Francisco, CA, 94105!

In our understanding, it is \"how well you can understand the internals of your system by examining its outputs\". We believe that the interconnection between metrics, logging, and distributed tracing gives you the ability to reason about the state of your system in order to debug exceptions and latency in your applications.

          "description": "Test driven development (TDD)\nTest driven development, or TDD, is a method of directly coupling testing with every part of your daily development. Developers who use TDD typically start developing by first writing a test that fails, and then writing the code that makes the test pass. This approach means that product code is more likely to get high test coverage, and the tests typically come first.\n \nMany developers find this pattern useful to help them prioritize good architecture from the start of development, and to stay laser-focused on each part of the functionality they need to implement. This school of thought advocates for testing not being an after-thought of development, but rather a driving force.\n \nFor example, in the following image, you can see that AddTest is written and fail…",

          "description": "Many work apps need the ability to schedule a meeting with others in their organization. Here's how to do it for apps connected to Microsoft 365.\n \nWork apps need work data\nWork apps serve a specific purpose: they help you track projects, follow orders or manage resources. But rarely do they contain all the information that users need to complete their work. Typically, information about people, their calendars, or communication is stored elsewhere, like in Microsoft 365. And that's a shame because completing a task requires users to switch between different apps, which is detrimental to their productivity. Unless of course, you bring work data into your work app.\n \nFind a meeting time and schedule a meeting on Microsoft 365\nA common scenario for work apps is to schedule a meeting with others in the organization. While it sounds trivial, the app must be able to access attendees' calendars, find a suitable meeting time and schedule the meeting. And that's where Microsoft Graph comes in.\n \nRecently I published an article on freeCodeCamp that shows you how to build an app connected to Microsoft 365 that can find a meeting time and schedule a meeting.\n \n\n \nThe app shows you how to make the best use of features available in the Microsoft Graph Toolkit and Microsoft Graph to build a UI that you could integrate with another app.\n \nWant to learn more joing our 30 days of Graph challenge runs from November 1-30, 2022. Watch  this short YouTube video to find out why you should participate! \n \nRegister for the 30 Days of Microsoft Graph Challenge today.\n \nCheck it out, and I'm looking forward to hearing what you think!",

Never again fiddle with setting up a login, handling access tokens, building web requests, and dealing with errors.\n \nLearn Microsoft Graph Toolkit interactively\nTo help you learn what Microsoft Graph Toolkit has to offer and how you'd use it in your app, we recently released a new learning path on Microsoft Learn. By following a few learn modules you'll learn everything that you need to know to use the toolkit in your app. But that's not all.\nThinking about the different ways in which people learn, we've launched an experiment - an interactive code tour that you can follow to add Microsoft Graph Toolkit to a React app.\n\n \n\n \nBy following the instructions in the tour, you gradually extend an empty React app with Microsoft Graph Toolkit turning it into a true Microsoft 365 app. What's cool about this code tour, is that it puts the code of your app in the center. Rather than reading long-form, you're in the code and get relevant, and in-place tips for building your app.\n \nThe Microsoft Graph Toolkit React code tour is a great way to quickly experience how you'd use the toolkit in a React app. We'd love it if you gave it a try and told us what you think. Shall we consider building tours for other technologies and scenarios?\n \nTry the Microsoft Graph Toolkit React code tour",

          "description": "If you're a web developer, there's an exciting opportunity for you to build applications for Microsoft 365, which many organizations across the world use for work. Let me show you, how you can use your existing skills and build your first application that integrates with Microsoft 365 in just 10 minutes.\n \nWhat's Microsoft 365?\nMicrosoft 365 is a set of applications, like Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Word, or SharePoint, that organizations use for work. Every day, millions of people use Microsoft 365 to chat, meet, send emails, create documents, and more.\n \nBut Microsoft 365 isn't just a set of apps. It's also a platform that enables developers, like yourself, to build applications. These apps can tap into data and insights stored on Microsoft 365 and bring them into people's workflows.\n \nBuilding for a platform\nBuilding for a platform isn't trivial. It comes with all kinds of specific knowledge you have to have like what tooling, SDKs, and APIs to use, how to integrate your app, and finally how to package and distribute it. What many people forget though, is that you don't have to learn everything about everything at once. Often, you can start simple and build up from there.\n \nBuild your first Microsoft 365 app in just 10 minutes\nRecently, I published an article on freeCodeCamp that shows you how you can build your first Microsoft 365 app in just 10 minutes.\n\n \n\n \nSure, the app is simple and doesn't do much, but when building it, you'll learn the fundamental concepts of building apps on Microsoft 365. And after these 10 minutes, you'll have a functional app that works and retrieves data from Microsoft 365, and which you can use as a starting point for more complex apps.\n \nGive it a try, and we're looking forward to hearing what you think.",

That’s massive transformation.\nWe all started Data Modelling from Nursey School --- Ahmed Oyelowo (MVP, MCT. AFM). I really don’t have anything to add to this rather than being so surprised that it is actually true. This just made it clear that the topic of Data Modelling in Power BI was demystified as if the audience are Nursery school students and every illustrations, examples, scenarios cited were great, relevant, and relatable.\n \nI wouldn’t be breaking down this session for you, you need to watch this for yourself.

What does this mean in numbers? If you deployed an application to a user group of 1000, around 200 of them will have a permanent disability and another 200 who consider themselves to have a temporary or situational impairment. That is around 400 users who will rely on various features in your application to make their experience better.\n \nAt Microsoft, we're passionate about empowering every person regardless of their condition. Accessibilitech Hackathon is one way Microsoft is committing to empowering people with disabilities to create, consume, and share content in their preferred way. But as a developer, how can you make your applications more accessible especially when building with Microsoft's Power Platform? It's easier than you think!\n \nIn this session on Microsoft Reactor, join Kristine Kolodziejski (Principal Technical Consultant based in the UK) and Japhlet Nwamu (Cloud Advocate at Microsoft) as they would walk you through a few tricks that would\n\nAllow your users to switch themes dynamically,\nAllow your users change font size in your apps dynamically,\nMake your apps multilingual in less than ONE MINUTE\nEnable you integrate text-to-speech in your apps and build your own screen reader,\nGuide you through the do's and don'ts of design,\nHelp you leverage built-in Windows tools to create more accessible design,\nSave user preferences for next time they launch the app! 🤩\n\nTo make it even better, all of these can be achieved WITHOUT premium connectors!

To support this, we have increased the number of nodes you can have in a single Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster from 1,000 to 5,000.  This will allow you to reduce the number of clusters needed to run your workloads, reducing the operational overhead needed to support application teams.\n \nWhen using the uptime SLA you can request a quota increase across all node pools in the cluster by raising a support request.  \n \nNetworking at scale\n \nOne of the things we hear a lot from our customers is around IP address exhaustion.  The release of Dynamic IP allocation has helped to reduce the need to pre-allocate IP…",

Today, we're excited to share that you can deploy Nuxt 3 applications with universal rendering to Azure Static Web Apps.\n \nWhile Nuxt 2 is known for its ease of use, Nuxt 3 brings even faster performance and improved developer experience with a thrilling new set of underlying technologies and features. With the release of Nuxt 3’s release candidate in April 2022, developers witnessed a complete re-architect of the framework. Nuxt 2 apps that have been upgraded with Nuxt Bridge also work with Azure Static Web Apps.\n \nWhat’s new in Nuxt 3? \n \n\nZero-configuration deployment of Nuxt 3 and Nuxt Bridge applications with universal rendering to Azure Static Web Apps \nAPI routes support for automatic generation from server API and middleware directories \nVue 3 support including composition API with imported functions for better code re-usability \nNitro Engine, a full stack server that allows deployment of output on Node.js, serverless, edge-side rendering, or as static \nVite, a frontend tooling that features fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimizes assets for production \n\nUniversal rendering vs static rendering\n \nPreviously, you were able to deploy a static rendered Nuxt app on Azure Static Web Apps, where the entire app is pre-generated as static content. However, Nuxt 3 also supports universal rendering, which provides the performance and search engine optimization of server-side rendering while still enabling client-side interactivity.\n \nWith Nuxt 3's support for Azure Static Web Apps, you can now deploy sites with universal rendering. \n \nTo learn more, check out the Nuxt 3 site deployment with universal rendering on Azure Static Web Apps documentation that also includes a tutorial.\n \nNuxt 3 Sample App on Azure Static Web Apps\n \nNuzhat Minhaz is a Program Manager Intern on the Azure Static Web App team at Microsoft.

Network with community members and peers to learn about the latest Java innovations on Kubernetes.  It's a free, one-day online event, so attend a few sessions or stay on for the whole thing. \n \nJoin us for a full day of sessions, including those presented my Microsoft Java product and Advocate teams, to help you gain valuable industry insights and vital job skills from the Java-4-Kubernetes community experts.\n \nMicrosoft's event schedule includes:\n\nWhat's up at Eclipse Adoptium? -- by George Adams\nTake the suckage out of Microservices with Container Apps -- by Rory Preddy\nSecrets of Performance Tuning Java on Kubernetes -- by Bruno Borges\nDeploying to Spring boot apps to Kubernetes with GitHub Actions and feature flags -- by Brian Benz and Stephanie Crater\n\n \n\n \nThis year's keynote by Mark Little, VP of Engineering at Red Hat, will be on \"Transactional Microservices in Kube-native Manner\" where he dives into the role it place in distributed computing, which is not necessarily the kind of transaction developers typically use. Quarkus and Eclipse MicroProfile are examples of what this looks like today.\n \nSpecial guest speaker, Lasada Pippen is a ground up, self-established engineering and technologist who now inspires people to overcome odds and face difficulties to pursue your dreams. For J4K, he will talk about \"Hidden Gems\" that you are and how to make cloud companies recognize this. Lasada will help you identify how valuable you are even if you're not being immediately recognized, how to navigate through this, and overcome hurdles to harness your success.\n \nThis is a once-a-year event with over two dozen sessions, exciting keynotes, and lots of learnings. So, what do you have to lose? Register for free and join the Java on Kubernetes community on September 28, 2022. Reserve your seat now.",

TLS is a standard cryptographic protocol that ensures privacy and data integrity between clients and services over the Internet. For more information about TLS, see Transport Layer Security.\n \nAzure Service Bus supports choosing a specific TLS version for namespaces. Currently Azure Service Bus uses TLS 1.2 on public endpoints by default, but TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are still supported for backward compatibility.\n \nAzure Service Bus namespaces permit clients to send and receive data with TLS 1.0 and above. To enforce stricter security measures, you can configure your Service Bus namespace to require that clients send and receive data with a newer version of TLS. If a Service Bus namespace requires a minimum version of TLS, then any requests made with an older version will fail. \n \nThanks to your input and feedback, this feature is now in general availability.\n \n\n \nTo learn more, see Enforce a minimum required version of Transport Layer Security (TLS) for requests to a Service Bus namespace.",

Along the way we've covered federated credentials, managed identity, EasyAuth and more. It has been neatly packaged into CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions as well for further streamlining. I'm happy with the results so far even though some of it took quite the effort to pull off.\n \nThe EasyAuth login process was pretty much as far as we got regarding the user facing side of things as most of the work was behind the scenes making the infra work without the use of passwords and client secrets.

This post is not about how best to work the xml mojo with custom policies. What we will try to make smoother is the testability part.\n \nLet me take a step back here and explain. The built-in policies are great as a user-friendly way for implementing simple authentication use cases. A couple of clicks in the Azure Portal to create a policy, test it in the Portal as well, and send off a couple of parameters to the dev team to inject in their code and that's it.

When the built-in user flows don't cut it you have to create custom policies based on XML, but it has been a somewhat bumpy ride getting the custom policies you craft uploaded to Azure. In the beginning you could only do it through the Azure Portal which made for a manual and error-prone deployment process. After a couple of interim improvements along the way we have eventually gotten to where it's possible to have an Azure DevOps based pipeline setup  invoking REST APIs to get the policies into the right place.

When the built-in user flows don't cut it you have to create custom policies based on XML, but it has been a somewhat bumpy ride getting the custom policies you craft uploaded to Azure. In the beginning you could only do it through the Azure Portal which made for a manual and error-prone deployment process. After a couple of interim improvements along the way we have eventually gotten to where it's possible to have an Azure DevOps based pipeline setup  invoking REST APIs to get the policies into the right place.

          "description": "Background  \nThe Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a management platform that you can use to manage your IT and development infrastructure with configuration as code. The Azure Desired State Configuration (DSC) extension helps bootstrap a VM to the Azure Automation State Configuration (DSC) service. The DSC extension can be installed on Azure VMs as a Virtual Machine Extension.  The DSCForLinux extension installs the OMI and DSC agent on Azure virtual machines.  \n  \nOver the past year, our team has been developing Automatic Extension Upgrade which now supports the DSC extension. When Automatic Extension Upgrade for the DSC extension is enabled on a VM, the extension is upgraded automatically whenever Microsoft releases a new version for the extension.

This past year, we have been working to support customers more holistically, shipping the public preview of  “Apply and Monitor” and “Apply and Autocorrect” assignment types, and are working hard on the upcoming GA of these capabilities.\n \nWe have been listening to our customers as well as the community and are excited to announce a name that highlights the current and future capabilities of our service. Guest configuration will become machine configuration. In addition to the name change, we are moving under the Automanage brand umbrella to reinforce the message that the goal of machine configuration is to reduce op-ex and customer burden in managing their Windows and Linux machines both in Azure and on-premises. It is important to note that the current experience within policy will not change. Customers will still be able to apply machine configurations at scale through policy assignments as they have thus far. \n \nThis rebranding will go live soon in the Azure portal as well as our documentation.

It is a new capability in Azure Monitor to help Java developers troubleshoot performance issues and uncover performance bottlenecks. \n  \nUnder the hood, it uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to profile your application using a customized configuration.  For additional context, JFR is a tool that collects profiling data of running Java applications, and it is integrated into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). JFR comes with little to barely noticeable overhead cost which makes it great to run on heavily loaded production deployments. \n  \nUsing the customized configuration, you can generate profiles in two ways: \n  \n\nAutomated Profiling - Configure CPU and memory thresholds to automatically trigger a profile recording. \nOn-demand Profiling - Use “Profile Now” to run near real-time profile recording. \n\n To try out the Java Profiler:\n \n\nEnable Azure Monitor Application Insights using v3.4.1 jar file or later. \nEnable the profiler using the java profiler installation guidance and set your CPU/Memory triggers for automatic profiling. \nClick the \"Profiler\" button on the Application Insights Performance Blade and click \"Profile Now\" for an on-demand profile. \nDownload the profiling session when it becomes available (it may take about 5 minutes to show up in Portal). \nView and analyze the profile with Java Mission Control (JMC) or another tool (java profiles are not currently viewable in Portal). \n\n  \n\n \n  \nJava Profiling is in preview today and can be enabled across all your JVMs. Even better, it is included in Application Insights for no additional cost. Try it out and let us know what you think!",
