I do learn Go to better understand Kubernetes, for example.\r\nOf course, we deal with some primitives and basic structures, first of all.\r\nThen we implement some well-known algorithms like bubble sort, Fibonacci number or sqrt function to get used to the language style and expectations.\r\nAnd now what?\r\nWe have some real use-cases where this or that functionality…",

          "description": "Hot on the heels of Spring Boot 3.0.2, I am excited to announce the 0.3 release of Spring Modulith.\r\nThe release is packed with improvements.\r\nWe have tweaked a couple of things that might require your attention and a couple of adapting changes to your code.\r\nThe most notable changes are:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-114 – We renamed the ….modulith.model package to ….modulith.core. This primarily affects ApplicationModules. Please adapt your imports accordingly.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-120 – The documentation support now generates diagram files using the *.puml file extension, as suggested by PlantUML. Please adapt your imports accordingly.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-103 – ApplicationModuleInitializer implementations will be triggered upon application startup, in the order following the application module dependency structure (more core ones are invoked first). Also, ApplicationModules exposes a ….getComparator() to order Spring beans that way. Note, that this requires the JGraphT library to be on the classpath (automatically pulled in via the spring-modulith-runtime artifact). See the reference documentation for details.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-116 – PublishedEvents now sees events published from asynchronous event listeners, too.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-100 – If you’re using AssertJ in your tests, you can now use AssertablePublishedEvents for a more streamlined integration  (for example, assertThat(events).contains(MyEvent.class).matching(…)).\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-117 – As we incentivize event-based, asynchronous application module integration, the test starter now also pulls in Awaitility.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-111 – We now publish aggregated Javdoc.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFind a complete change log in the GitHub release page. We are looking forward to your feedback in the GitHub discussions.",

While the cache is useful for improving performance, it can also become cluttered over time and slow down the app. Deleting the cache can help improve Microsoft Teams performance by reducing the amount of temporary data stored which can also free up storage space. \n \nThe Microsoft Teams cache can be deleted manually by deleting all the files and folders in the %appdata%\\Microsoft\\Teams directory for each user profile.

          "description": "Modern applications are typically architected as distributed collections of microservices, with each collection of microservices performing some discrete business function. This distributed microservices architecture allows multiple teams within large organizations to operate independently of each other and release new versions of their microservices at their own cadence. However, this requires an additional level of supervision to address observability, traffic management, and security use cases for service-to-service communication across these distributed workloads. This can be done by embedding logic directly within the application code of each microservice. Or it can be done in a transparent way using service mesh which deploys sidecars to application pods to achieve the same use cases…",

Azure AD Workload Identity, is simpler to use and replaces pod identity. Azure AD Workload Identity on AKS is now generally available so customers can run production workloads using Workload Identity on both Windows and Linux and migrate applications using Pod Identity over to Workload Identity. \n \nAzure AD Workload Identity leverages Service Account Token Volume Projection giving pods the ability to use a Kubernetes identity (service account), to which a Kubernetes token is issued and OIDC federation which enables Kubernetes applications to access Azure cloud resources securely with Azure Active Directory based on annotated service accounts.\n \nSince the open-source pod identity project is now deprecated, AKS will continue to support the AKS pod identity through 2023. To ease the transition, customers can run Pod Identity and Workload Identity in parallel on an existing AKS cluster.  Please note that during the Public Preview we enabled the sidecar to give customers time to update their SDKs, but this is not a supported configuration for General Availability. We recommend that customers update applications to a list of supported SDKs that will allow applications to talk to the AAD endpoint.",

With workloads configured to consume only the necessary resources and dynamically scale to meet demand, businesses can optimize resource usage while reducing downtime. Additionally, Kubernetes allows organizations to deploy multiple applications from various teams or business units to a single cluster, resulting in significantly reduced infrastructure costs. However, this multitenancy approach poses a new challenge.\n \nConsider this scenario: your cluster generates $100/day in infrastructure spend with a shared set of resources split across 10 developer teams. If 1 team consumes 80% of the cluster’s resources, it does not make sense to split infrastructure costs evenly across all teams at $10/day. Instead, your organ…",

          "description": "Azure and Red Hat have had a long-standing partnership to provide customers with best-in-class cloud solutions, such as jointly-supported Azure Red Hat OpenShift, JBoss EAP on Azure App Service, and deployment templates for JBoss EAP on Azure RHEL VM’s. Organizations which are moving existing, on-premises deployments to the cloud at scale need purpose-built tooling that can help automate the process of analyzing their portfolio of applications for cloud readiness. To bridge that gap, we are excited to announce that Microsoft Azure has begun contributing to Red Hat’s Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA), a tool that supports large-scale Java application modernization and migration projects across a broad range of transformations and use cases by automating source-code analysis and providing line-by-line recommendations to migrate your applications to new Java runtimes or the Azure cloud. These contributions to the Red Hat MTA provide service-specific migration recommendations for Azure App Service.\n \n\n \nThe collaboration adds rulesets to the open source upstream of the MTA, known as Windup. These new rules search for some common scenarios and provide guidance for accomplishing the task in Azure:\n\nConfiguring data sources\nJava Key Store usage for certificates\nUsing Maven to deploy to App Service\nProper use of the file system in Azure\nUsing Azure Service Bus for JMS\nUsing Azure Active Directory as an identity provider\n… and more!\n\n \nCheck out this Video Demo for more information.\n \nYou can download the web or CLI client of the Migration Toolkit for Applications from the Red Hat’s website or install it as a VS Code plugin.\n \nHave questions or comments?

You can use system-assigned or user-assigned managed identities with Event Hubs capturing destinations.\nManaged identities provide an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure AD authentication. Applications can use managed identities to obtain Azure AD tokens without having to manage any credentials.\n\n \nIn the context of Event Hubs capture feature, these manage identities are used to authenticate and authorize the event capturing agent with the capture destinations such as Azure Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen1 or Gen2.\nWhen configuring event capturing for a given event hub/Kafka topic, users can enable capture and select system assigned or user assigned identity as the authentication mode.\n\n \nEvent Hubs Capture feature also supports capturing data to a capture destination in a different subscription with the use of managed identity.\n \nNext steps\nIn conclusion, the introduction of managed identity support for event stream capturing in Event Hubs marks a significant expansion of our event streaming and storing capabilities. Now you can experience the power of secure stream capture and unleash the full potential of your event-driven architecture with Event Hubs.\nTo learn more about Event Hubs capture feature, see Capture streaming events - Azure Event Hubs.",

With dev tunnels, you can also share your local work in-progress with colleagues or clients to get feedback asynchronously without the hassle of deploying. Previously, the only way you could use dev tunnels was through Visual Studio 2022.\n \nToday, we are thrilled to announce the public preview of the devtunnel CLI! To create, host, and connect to your first dev tunnel in seconds, please follow the documentation on Microsoft Learn.\n \n\n \nUse cases\nHere are some of the scenarios that dev tunnels enable with the devtunnel CLI or dev tunnels in Visual Studio 2022.\n\nTest an app with external services. For instance, test and debug Power Platform connectors, Azure Communication Services APIs, or Twilio webhooks.\nTest and debug a web app on other devices, like mobile phones and tablets.\nMake an app temporarily available to others to review your work in progress on a web app or API.\n\nBenefits\n\nSecure by default – Each dev tunnel you create is only accessible to you using your Microsoft, Microsoft Azure Active Directory or GitHub account.\nPersistent URLs - Retain the same tunnel URL for extended periods of time.\nSupport for multiple simultaneous ports - Host multiple ports on a single tunnel at the same time.\nGlobal service availability - The dev tunnels service is available globally. Tunnels are automatically created in the closest available region to ensure optimal performance.\nTunnel inspection - Inspect tunnel traffic in a familiar interface, browser DevTools, to monitor and manage your web apps or webhooks.\n\nTo improve the devtunnel CLI, we encourage you to connect with us through GitHub issues to request a feature or submit a bug.

Tape storage is not used only for backup in case of system failure, but also for archiving data for long-term storage.\n \nTape backup is a term typically applied to old/outdated technologies, but tapes are still being used to back up the data.

Simply put, it exposes your Azure VMware Solution resources (VMs, networks, datastores, etc.) to the Azure portal.\n \nUsing Arc for Azure VMware Solution, those resources can be managed via the Azure portal, even though they are within your vSphere cluster running in an Azure datacenter. Even better, there is no cost to deploy Arc for Azure VMware Solution. More blogs to come on Arc for Azure VMware Solution, but if you want to get some more details check out this video from Jeremiah Megie.\n \nFirst things first. Let’s get Arc for Azure VMware Solution installed into your private cloud.\nYou will need to collect the following information to input into the PowerShell script, which, if you use it, will make the deployment a bit more straightforward.\n \n\nSubscription ID and Resource Group where the Azure VMware Solution private cloud is deployed.\n Name of the Azure VMware Solution private cloud.\n /28 network segment for the ARC appliance.\n\n\nThe/28 network segment will be an NSX-T segment in the private cloud. Under the covers, the deployment script creates NSX-T segment for use by the ARC appliances. The value must be entered into the script as the gateway to the segment, followed by /28. For example, if 192.168.99.1/28 is entered, there will be a /28 NSX-T segment created with the gateway 192.168.99.1.\n \nThe other information you can get from the Overview blade of your private cloud.\n \n\n \nRequirements\n\nYour private cloud must have Internet access.\nAlso, because of the appliance size, ideally you would want to run this script as close to the private cloud, or from a machine inside the AVS Private Cloud.\n\nThe script can be found here;\nhttps://virtualworkloads.com/2023/02/deploy-arc-for-azure-vmware-solution-simply-using-powershell/#script",

          "description": "We’re excited to let you know that Azure Monitor – Container Insights now supports multiline logging! With this feature enabled, previously split container logs are stitched together and sent as single entries to the ContainerLogV2 table. Customers are able see container log lines up to 64 KB (up from the existing 16 KB limit). If the stitched log line is larger than 64 KB, it gets truncated due to Log Analytics limits. This feature enables the customers to directly consume the logs in meaningful ways without having to spend time stitching them with custom Kusto queries. Additionally, the feature also adds support for .NET and Go stack traces, which appear as single entries instead of being split into multiple entries in ContainerLogV2 table.\n \nWhy this is important:\nLogs are an essential part of monitoring and troubleshooting applications running in containers. However, when logs are split across multiple lines, it can be challenging to consume them effectively. View the example of Multi-Line below:\n \nMulti-Line Disabled\n\n \nMulti-Line Enabled\n\n \n \nTo enable multi-line logging:\n1. Make sure agent is updated to version 3.1.6 or later\n2. Customers must enable ContainerLogV2 for multi-line logging to work. Go to the ConfigMap to enable ContainerLogV2 in Container Insights.\n\n3. Set enable_multiline_logs flag to “true” in the config map.\n\n4. Apply the ConfigMap:\nkubectl apply -f container-azm-ms-agentconfig.yaml\n \nNext steps for multi-line logging:\nRead more about the ContainerLogV2 schema here.\n \nPlease share any feedback for this feature using this form: https://forms.office.com/r/FCDvikMZ0S",
