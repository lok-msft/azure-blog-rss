          "description": "Hot on the heels of Spring Boot 3.0.2, I am excited to announce the 0.3 release of Spring Modulith.\r\nThe release is packed with improvements.\r\nWe have tweaked a couple of things that might require your attention and a couple of adapting changes to your code.\r\nThe most notable changes are:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-114 – We renamed the ….modulith.model package to ….modulith.core. This primarily affects ApplicationModules. Please adapt your imports accordingly.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-120 – The documentation support now generates diagram files using the *.puml file extension, as suggested by PlantUML. Please adapt your imports accordingly.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-103 – ApplicationModuleInitializer implementations will be triggered upon application startup, in the order following the application module dependency structure (more core ones are invoked first). Also, ApplicationModules exposes a ….getComparator() to order Spring beans that way. Note, that this requires the JGraphT library to be on the classpath (automatically pulled in via the spring-modulith-runtime artifact). See the reference documentation for details.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-116 – PublishedEvents now sees events published from asynchronous event listeners, too.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-100 – If you’re using AssertJ in your tests, you can now use AssertablePublishedEvents for a more streamlined integration  (for example, assertThat(events).contains(MyEvent.class).matching(…)).\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-117 – As we incentivize event-based, asynchronous application module integration, the test starter now also pulls in Awaitility.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-111 – We now publish aggregated Javdoc.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFind a complete change log in the GitHub release page. We are looking forward to your feedback in the GitHub discussions.",

          "description": "New releases of Spring Boot are being released on a quite frequent schedule and updating your projects to newer versions of Spring Boot is something that many teams and organizations around the globe do as part of their daily work.\n\r\nSometimes those upgrades are simple and easy, for example for new patch releases that mostly include changes to fix bugs and address CVEs. In contrast to that, upgrading to a new minor or even a new major version requires more work, including code changes to adapt to new or changed APIs, updating configurations to not use deprecated keys anymore, and more.\n\r\nEach new minor or major version of Spring therefore ships with a comprehensive guide and documentation about those changes and you can read and follow to upgrade your project.

This has given me a chance to do a little, shall we say, Spring cleaning, and also update my Github Actions to the latest and greatest.

I was just at Devoxx in Belgium, where hundreds of experts from across the Java ecosystem converged for the first time since 2019 to deliver their biggest and best. \n\r\nI could do a proper trip report, but I really just came here to point you to two talks from two of my amazing teammates, Stéphane Nicoll (@snicoll) and Brian Clozel (@bclozel), who have been very hard at work on both Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, both of which will land by the end of November, 2022. These are brand new generations of the framework, implying huge new paradigms and new opportunities for developers. \n\r\nThis first is a broader, whirlwind tour of the new features in Spring Framework 6 (which bubble up into Spring Boot 3).\n\r\n\r\nThis second one introduces the new ahead-of-time (AOT) support in Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, which makes it trivial to build GraalVM native images.\n\r\n\n\r\nNB: please ignore the metadata for the YouTube videos. Both talks feature both speakers, and there is no mention whatsoever of React and JavaScript and the like. I think that was a metadata issue with the publication of the videos on YouTube, which will hopefully be resolved. \n\r\nEnjoy! \n\r\nIf you missed this event, that’s OK - there’s still time to join the Spring team and larger Java ecosystem for SpringOne, being held 6-8 December, 2022, in sunny San Francisco, CA, 94105!

          "description": "As a developer, you're likely familiar with the concept of \"quotas\" when it comes to using cloud-based services. These limits are put in place to ensure that resources are used efficiently and to prevent any one user from consuming too many resources. In this post, we'll take a look at how quotas are affected by Codespaces and provide some suggestions for avoiding the limits on free Codespaces.\n \nBefore getting into the suggestions, it's important to recognize two key features of how Codespaces effect quotas: \n\nEvery Codespace that has been created (but not deleted) has the potential to deplete your included quota.\nRunning Codespaces will use both CPU core-hours and storage, while stopped Codespaces will consume your storage quota only.\n\n \nIt can be tricky to figure out exactly how your Co…",

          "description": "A picture showing .NET\nWhat is .NET MAUI?\n.NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) is a cross-platform framework for creating native mobile and desktop apps with C# and XAML. Using .NET MAUI, you can develop apps that can run on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows from a single shared code-base.\nUsing .NET MAUI, you can create multi-platform apps using a single project, but you can add platform-specific source code and resources if necessary. One of the key aims of .NET MAUI is to enable you to implement as much of your app logic and UI layout as possible in a single code-base.\n \nIn this blog, we will cover how to Build a Water Consumption Mobile App using .NET MAUI that consumes historical data from a Web API. This solution is part of a project build for .NET Conf Student Zone 2022\n \nWhat will we be doing?\nBefore you can get started, we need a few things set up first:\n\nBuild a Mininal API from scratch to consume in your app\nBuild your first .NET MAUI App\nAdd a Consumption.cs class with the following propertiesA picture showing the Consumption.cs class\nAdd a APIManager.cs class to house the HTTP methods for your APIA picture showing the APIManager.cs class\n\nAfter the above are added, you can start to:\n\nConsume A Web API – this will show how you to consume the historical data stored in the Web API and display on your mobile app.\nSend data to your Web API using the HTTP Post Method (shown in the link above too).\n\n \nWe have a dedicated Microsoft learn module that will show you how to Consume and Send Data to your Web API. All of the code for this part of the project and other parts are available on the .NET Student Zone Githup Repositry\n \nTo see and understand the how to implement this in Visual Studio you can watch my session below.\n\nFinally, if you are curious about where the API data comes from, you can explore the other sessions of the .Net Student Conf and understand how all the different pieces and different technologies of .NET ecosystem are combined together into a single e-2-e project.",

In short terms, GitHub is known as the developer's best friend. \nAs software and technologies continue to evolve, also Github platform and services are constantly evolving. In this blog post, I wish to show you how the latest Git tools, GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Copilot, can transform and support the world of education.\n \nIn the following video, you'll be listening about two stories, whose scenarios will be familiar to anyone who is studying or teaching at University, or simply anyone who ever learned a new programming language/framework or prepared a hands-on workshop to deliver. \nThe first story's character is Ali, a Data Science teacher at the University of Nowhere. She is preparing for her spring semester course and in particular, she’s preparing a guided tutorial, with a full list of all the instructions her students will need to set up the environment for her Python lab.\nThe second story is about Mark. Mark is a student at University of Nowhere. He attended the Python data science lab by prof Ali and now he needs to complete the assignment at home. However, he gets stuck at some point.\n \nHow Github Codespaces and Github Copilot will help them and make their tasks easier? Watch the video below to find out the answer.\n\n\n\n \nUseful resources:\n\nLearn more about GitHub for Education and all the benefits for students and educators.\nExplore and build upon all the GitHub Codespaces templates for education.\nIf you missed GitHub Universe, read all the latest announcements. \nLearn more about Visual Studio Code and VS Code Extenstions which make it even easier to harness GitHub Codespaces.",

          "description": "Test driven development (TDD)\nTest driven development, or TDD, is a method of directly coupling testing with every part of your daily development. Developers who use TDD typically start developing by first writing a test that fails, and then writing the code that makes the test pass. This approach means that product code is more likely to get high test coverage, and the tests typically come first.\n \nMany developers find this pattern useful to help them prioritize good architecture from the start of development, and to stay laser-focused on each part of the functionality they need to implement. This school of thought advocates for testing not being an after-thought of development, but rather a driving force.\n \nFor example, in the following image, you can see that AddTest is written and fail…",

          "description": "Many work apps need the ability to schedule a meeting with others in their organization. Here's how to do it for apps connected to Microsoft 365.\n \nWork apps need work data\nWork apps serve a specific purpose: they help you track projects, follow orders or manage resources. But rarely do they contain all the information that users need to complete their work. Typically, information about people, their calendars, or communication is stored elsewhere, like in Microsoft 365. And that's a shame because completing a task requires users to switch between different apps, which is detrimental to their productivity. Unless of course, you bring work data into your work app.\n \nFind a meeting time and schedule a meeting on Microsoft 365\nA common scenario for work apps is to schedule a meeting with others in the organization. While it sounds trivial, the app must be able to access attendees' calendars, find a suitable meeting time and schedule the meeting. And that's where Microsoft Graph comes in.\n \nRecently I published an article on freeCodeCamp that shows you how to build an app connected to Microsoft 365 that can find a meeting time and schedule a meeting.\n \n\n \nThe app shows you how to make the best use of features available in the Microsoft Graph Toolkit and Microsoft Graph to build a UI that you could integrate with another app.\n \nWant to learn more joing our 30 days of Graph challenge runs from November 1-30, 2022. Watch  this short YouTube video to find out why you should participate! \n \nRegister for the 30 Days of Microsoft Graph Challenge today.\n \nCheck it out, and I'm looking forward to hearing what you think!",

It shows you how to get information from the user's calendar and check their availability for a particular time slot. And it's also a great way to get started with building apps on Microsoft 365.\n \nThe tutorial shows you the basics of setting up auth in a single-page app and using the Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK to connect to the Microsoft Graph API. It also demonstrates working with calendar views and formatting dates.This is just one of many scenarios and types of apps that you can implement on Microsoft 365. For more information about the type of data and insights stored on Microsoft 365 that you can tap into, check out the Microsoft Graph API documentation.\n \nGive it a try, and we're looking forward to hearing what you think.\n30 Days of Microsoft Graph is a gamified learning experience for beginners to challenge themselves on building apps with Microsoft Graph and JavaScript based on the Top Microsoft Graph Scenarios, for a chance to win exciting prizes.\n\n \nThe challenge will start on November 1st and end on November 30th.

Toolkit's components help you retrieve relevant data from Microsoft 365 and show it in your app in any way you want. And with toolkit's authentication providers, setting up auth is a matter of adding a few lines of code. Never again fiddle with setting up a login, handling access tokens, building web requests, and dealing with errors.\n \nLearn Microsoft Graph Toolkit interactively\nTo help you learn what Microsoft Graph Toolkit has to offer and how you'd use it in your app, we recently released a new learning path on Microsoft Learn. By following a few learn modules you'll learn everything that you need to know to use the toolkit in your app. But that's not all.\nThinking about the different ways in which people learn, we've launched an experiment - an interactive code tour that you can follow to add Microsoft Graph Toolkit to a React app.\n\n \n\n \nBy following the instructions in the tour, you gradually extend an empty React app with Microsoft Graph Toolkit turning it into a true Microsoft 365 app. What's cool about this code tour, is that it puts the code of your app in the center. Rather than reading long-form, you're in the code and get relevant, and in-place tips for building your app.\n \nThe Microsoft Graph Toolkit React code tour is a great way to quickly experience how you'd use the toolkit in a React app. We'd love it if you gave it a try and told us what you think. Shall we consider building tours for other technologies and scenarios?\n \nTry the Microsoft Graph Toolkit React code tour",

          "description": "If you're a web developer, there's an exciting opportunity for you to build applications for Microsoft 365, which many organizations across the world use for work. Let me show you, how you can use your existing skills and build your first application that integrates with Microsoft 365 in just 10 minutes.\n \nWhat's Microsoft 365?\nMicrosoft 365 is a set of applications, like Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Word, or SharePoint, that organizations use for work. Every day, millions of people use Microsoft 365 to chat, meet, send emails, create documents, and more.\n \nBut Microsoft 365 isn't just a set of apps. It's also a platform that enables developers, like yourself, to build applications. These apps can tap into data and insights stored on Microsoft 365 and bring them into people's workflows.\n \nBuilding for a platform\nBuilding for a platform isn't trivial. It comes with all kinds of specific knowledge you have to have like what tooling, SDKs, and APIs to use, how to integrate your app, and finally how to package and distribute it. What many people forget though, is that you don't have to learn everything about everything at once. Often, you can start simple and build up from there.\n \nBuild your first Microsoft 365 app in just 10 minutes\nRecently, I published an article on freeCodeCamp that shows you how you can build your first Microsoft 365 app in just 10 minutes.\n\n \n\n \nSure, the app is simple and doesn't do much, but when building it, you'll learn the fundamental concepts of building apps on Microsoft 365. And after these 10 minutes, you'll have a functional app that works and retrieves data from Microsoft 365, and which you can use as a starting point for more complex apps.\n \nGive it a try, and we're looking forward to hearing what you think.",

However, questions like “what is the tidyverse” or “how does the tidymodels framework fit in it” might still have no clear answer for you.\n \nWhat is the tidyverse\nThe simplest way to describe the tidyverse is as a collection of R packages - sharing common ideas and norms - designed to perform data science tasks easily and quickly.

You get to keep everyone on the same page from product managers, program managers, business analyst, developers etc.\nThe main advantage of working with a Gantt Chart is that you get to plan, schedule, and execute your projects on just one chart.

Some of you may have learned about these new storage providers during the annual Build conference and/or from this preview announcement blog post.\n \nDurable Functions enables you to write long-running, reliable, event-driven, and stateful logic on the serverless Azure Functions platform using everyday imperative code. We believe the new storage providers will enable a host of new scenarios for apps using Durable Functions because they allow apps to run at a higher scale, with greater price-performance efficiency, and with more portability compared to the default option Azure Storage.\n \nWhy we developed the new storage provider…",

Create a new Web app for Windows using any available Runtime stack for Windows.\n\n \n2. After the creation complete, go to Kudu site from Azure Portal:\n\n \n3. Create a new directory and download the PHP runtime(Non Thread Safe Version) from PHP For Windows: Binaries and sources Releases and extract it, in this demo, we use php 8.2.1, the output is as below:\n \n \nmkdir php\ncurl https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.2.1-nts-Win32-vs16-x64.zip -o php\\php.zip\ncd php\nunzip php.zip\n \n \n\n\n \n4. Go to Path mappings in configuration. Add a new handler mapping. The extension is \"*.php\", the Script processor is \"C:\\home\\php\\php-cgi.exe\". Then save it. All the configuration is done.\n\n \n5. To verify it, we can create an \"index.php\" file under C:\\home\\site\\wwwroot with below content.

We have observed that some organisations prefer to follow a Segregated Model, where there is a requirement to separate the Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT) environments in the cloud. This is often the case for large organisations where the operational priorities for OT (Integrity, Availability and Confidentiality) differ from IT (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability).\n \nOn the other hand, other organisations, typically small to medium-sized, prefer to adopt a Converged Model which is simpler, more cost-effective and does not require a separation of the OT and IT environments.

We’ll start off our conversation with a level set about what we mean when we talk about building a platform.  \n \nA platform is a collection of technical capabilities that organizations have, which are intended to solve line-of-business problems.

Early October, Azure launched a campaign to address this unprecedented situation by empowering businesses to “Do More with Less”. The campaign focuses on three value elements – migrating and saving, optimizing existing cloud investments, and reinvesting to drive growth. Read more about each of these topics here. All three highlight the importance of cost optimization in one way or another. Azure Advisor is at the front and center of making some of these objectives a reality.

In new experience, there is\nRules management – Uses Data Collection Rules to configure or customize various aspects of data collection. For example, you can change the frequency of file collection. DCRs let you configure data collection for specific machines connected to a workspace as compared to the \"all or nothing\" approach of legacy agents.\n\nHow to get started?\nYou can onboard to Change Tracking & Inventory with AMA either via Azure Portal or by using Azury Policy (to onboard at scale). To onboard single VM via portal, click on specific VM name from Virtual Machines -> Change Tracking -> Enable using AMA agent (Preview). To know more about the various methods to enable Change Tracking, click here\nOnboarding from Single VM view\n\n \nOnboarding via DINE Policies (at scale onboarding)\n\nIn the public preview, Change Tracking with AMA supports Window Files, Windows Registry and Software data types. We are working towards facilitating the support of Windows services & Linux Daemons by GA. The data configuration can now be regulated at DCR level now. Click here to know more about Data Collection Rules.\n \nYou can check out our complete documentation to get more details.

The features have been in preview for several months now, being vetted by many Log Analytics customers including some of the largest retailers, banks, and healthcare providers in the world. With preview feedback addressed and services now fully scaled out to meet the complex needs of these users and more, we are today excited to announce the revamped custom logs features are now generally available!\n \nToday, we are announcing the following:\n\nGA of the Log Ingestion API. This secure, scalable, and flexible API is the path going forward for all custom data ingestion needs.\nGA of the Ingestion-time Transformations feature. This feature allows users to customize built-in data streams to parse, enrich, filter, or otherwise tailor incoming data to their specific use-cases.\nA pricing for data sent to the system and subsequently dropped in a transformation. A nominal fee per GB dropped will be charged for any data dropped beyond 50% of incoming data, calculated daily. The fee is waived for Azure Sentinel-enabled workspaces. While we're announcing billing today, we will not start charging yet as of this announcement, and will provide at least a 3-month notice before doing so. The Azure Monitor pricing page will be imminently updated with these details.\n\n \nScreenshot of ingestion-time transformation UI\n \n \n \nFor those of you who participated in our preview - thank you for your feedback, and to those new to the features - we're excited for you to start using them!

It is a new capability in Azure Monitor to help Java developers troubleshoot performance issues and uncover performance bottlenecks. \n  \nUnder the hood, it uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to profile your application using a customized configuration.  For additional context, JFR is a tool that collects profiling data of running Java applications, and it is integrated into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). JFR comes with little to barely noticeable overhead cost which makes it great to run on heavily loaded production deployments. \n  \nUsing the customized configuration, you can generate profiles in two ways: \n  \n\nAutomated Profiling - Configure CPU and memory thresholds to automatically trigger a profile recording. \nOn-demand Profiling - Use “Profile Now” to run near real-time profile recording. \n\n To try out the Java Profiler:\n \n\nEnable Azure Monitor Application Insights using v3.4.1 jar file or later. \nEnable the profiler using the java profiler installation guidance and set your CPU/Memory triggers for automatic profiling. \nClick the \"Profiler\" button on the Application Insights Performance Blade and click \"Profile Now\" for an on-demand profile. \nDownload the profiling session when it becomes available (it may take about 5 minutes to show up in Portal). \nView and analyze the profile with Java Mission Control (JMC) or another tool (java profiles are not currently viewable in Portal). \n\n  \n\n \n  \nJava Profiling is in preview today and can be enabled across all your JVMs. Even better, it is included in Application Insights for no additional cost. Try it out and let us know what you think!",

          "description": "About a year ago, we launched the Azure Monitor Agent (or AMA) as a powerful new agent from Azure Monitor and a simpler world of data collection. A lot of you adopted it already. Some witnessed a 50% cost reduction with the agent's filtering capabilities while others saw a reduction of 2000 person-hours using Data Collection Rules to centrally manage agent configuration. We also made a bunch of improvements (view past releases) in response to your growing needs around security, reliability, supporting new information, resource types, distros, operating systems, and network perimeters, to make the agent even more powerful and resilient. If you haven't already, adopt and migrate to AMA today to get all the benefits with more coming soon!\n \nI'm using the Log Analytics agents today - why shoul…",
