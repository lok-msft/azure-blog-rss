          "description": "While developing an application, the majority of the time, you use API calls to send and receive messages. Therefore, you should follow an authentication and authorisation process to use the API unless it's the public API. Those authentication/authorisation process uses either 1) an auth key or 2) an access token through an OAuth process.\n \nUsing the auth key approach, you can store it in a safe place like the Azure Key Vault service and fetch the key. It's a relatively simple process. However, if you need to use the OAuth process, it gets complicated with the following authorisation process. Here's the conceptual OAuth process.\n \n\nRequest an authorisation code\nReceive the authorisation code\nRequest an access token by providing the authorisation code\nReceive the access token and a refresh …",

          "description": "App Service Windows includes multiple versions of Tomcat. Sometimes, you may want to add custom configurations via web.xml file.\n \nBefore talking about how to change web.xml file in App Service windows, let's discuss \"what is web.xml\"?\n \nJava web applications use a deployment descriptor file to determine how URLs map to servlets, which URLs require authentication, and other information. This file is named web.xml and resides in the app's WAR under the WEB-INF/ directory. web.xml is part of the servlet standard for web applications.\n \nThe default Servlet configurations is under ${catalina.home}/conf. For each webapp, the settings could be found under ${catalina.home}/webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF.\n \nWhen tomcat deploys the application, it reads the generic configurations from conf/web.xml and then WEB-INF/web.xml in the web application. \n \nIt instructs the Tomcat which classes to load, what parameters to set in the context, and how to intercept requests coming from browsers.\nThere you specify:\n\nwhat servlets (and filters) you want to use and what URLs you want to map them to\nlisteners - classes that are notified when some events happen (context starts, session created, etc)\nconfiguration parameters (context-params)\nerror pages, welcome files\nsecurity constraints\n\nBack to our topic, if you haven't defined a custom error page, you will the default page as below:\n\n \nTo add a custom error page, please follow below steps:\n\nAdd <error-page></error-page> in web.xml under webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF. For example, my custom error page \"error.html\" is under root folder /webapp, so I should use \"/error.html\" in <location></location>.\n\n\n\nAdd your custom error in webapps folder.\n\n\n\nBuild and re-deploy the project to App Service.\nNow you will see the custom error page replace the default one.\n\n\n \nPlease kindly note, configurations won't take effect if you add web.xml directly in Kudu site. Tomcats only reads the configurations from war file during startup.",

For inbound access, you need private endpoints, which allow clients located in your private network to securely access your apps over Private Link, which eliminates exposure from the public internet.\n \nWith this update, you can use our lower-cost tiers and achieve the same level of security that you could previously only achieve with our high-end SKUs. Note that if you want to downgrade an existing App Service Plan and still use VNet integration, you need to be on the newer App Service footprint to ensure you’re App Service Plan supports VNet integration for Basic SKU.

As Kubernetes matured, and the needs of the community and our customers grew, the tight coupling of Docker to Kubernetes through dockershim (the interface between the Kubernetes platform and the Docker runtime) needed to evolve. On 2 December 2020, with the release of Kubernetes 1.20, Kubernetes announced it is deprecating Docker as a container runtime, through the use of dockershim, in a future release of Kubernetes.\n \nWith the upcoming Kubernetes 1.24 release, dockershim will be removed.\n \nIf you are using a supported Kubernetes version in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):\n\nFor Linux node pools, there is no action required on your part. All supported Kubernetes versions on AKS use containerd as the default runtime for Kubernetes 1.19 and greater.\nFor Windows Server 2019 node pools, in January 2021, we announced the general availability of containerd as the default container runtime for Kubernetes 1.23 and greater. If you are using a cluster with a Kubernetes version prior to 1.23, you can create a new node pool with containerd enabled before the switch over to it being the default in 1.23 then move your pods to the new pool.\n\n \nWe work very closely with the community through our participation in the Kubernetes Special Interest Groups (SIG) from Storage, to Windows and everything in between and I'd like to thank both the community and our engineering teams for the work to get to this milestone.",

          "description": "by Lucas Santos and Aaron Wislang\n \nIn our previous article we explored how to deploy Grafana and Prometheus on AKS. However, despite Prometheus being an excellent way to monitor your AKS cluster, it lacks some functionality to save metrics for future use and enable us to query historical data.\n \nPrometheus is a metrics collector, it can be used to collect metrics from any source, and it can be used to generate graphs. However, it is not a data storage solution and therefore isn't not focused on storing data for historical purposes. Prometheus has its storage solution and supports both on-disk storage as well as remote locations. You can configure a lot of options but the data management options are limited. This is where Thanos can help.\n \nThere is also a configuration overhead when we wa…",

With this feature, you'll be able to migrate your existing ASE as well as the apps running on that ASE to ASEv3. ASEv3 provides a number of feature differences as well as performance enhancements and potential reduced overall costs compared to previous versions. To get a complete overview on ASEv3, read the ASEv3 focused App Service Environment overview.\n\nCheck out the following docs to learn more about migrating to ASEv3:\n\n- Migrate to App Service Environment v3\n- How to Migrate to ASEv3\n\nPlease note, at this time, the public preview supports a subset of possible ASE configurations. Be sure to review the supported scenarios to see if you can migrate at this time using the feature and stay tuned for updates as we release additional capabilities.\n\nAn Azure portal experience for migration will be available at the start of February, 2022. Be on the lookout for additional announcements.\n\nIf your ASE isn't supported for migration using the migration feature and your ASE isn't listed under one of the upcoming supported scenarios, you have the option to migrate to ASEv3 manually.

TLS is a standard cryptographic protocol that ensures privacy and data integrity between clients and services over the Internet. For more information about TLS, see Transport Layer Security.\nAzure Service Bus supports choosing a specific TLS version for namespaces. Currently Azure Service Bus uses TLS 1.2 on public endpoints by default, but TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are still supported for backward compatibility.\nAzure Service Bus namespaces permit clients to send and receive data with TLS 1.0 and above. To enforce stricter security measures, you can configure your Service Bus namespace to require that clients send and receive data with a newer version of TLS. If a Service Bus namespace requires a minimum version of TLS, then any requests made with an older version will fail.\nTo learn more, see Enforce a minimum required version of Transport Layer Security (TLS) for requests to a Service Bus namespace.",

IoT-related architecture can be different than other architecture.\n \nThe first thing to point out in this landscape is that there are two distinct scenarios: brownfield and greenfield. Anytime you’re building something new, such as a factory, building or car, and you want to include Internet connected devices or components, you are working within a greenfield scenario. Anytime you want to connect existing devices and assets that may have been around for years to decades, this typically is a brownfield scenario.  The assets or devices were not designed to be network or internet connected by default.

This behaviour sometimes is not desirable as some application owners may not agree to share connectivity to other applications. Or would like to restrict access in or out of the backend applications running on certain pods. Network Policy comes to your rescue in those cases.\nNetwork policies or network security policies are kind of firewall rules for Kubernetes cluster. These are implemented with the help of Network Plugin or Container Network Interface (CNI) and control traffic flow at the IP address or port level (OSI layer 3 or 4). These policies are applied at the Namespace level and can restrict ingress and egress to and from a pod or a group of pods based on how they are configured. Please read…",

So, when you create a new pod, changes container image of your deployment or read information from a configmap or secret, you basically generate requests to the Kubernetes API. We can ask Kubernetes to record all these requests and related data and metadata in log repository called Audit Logs. Each event at its different stages of execution generates event record and can be stored in audit logs based on some pre-defined policies. Please read this article on auditing carefully to understand the defined stages and defined audit levels.

This blog focuses on Chaos engineering as a methodology that helps to build resilient, well-architected applications. I discuss how Azure Chaos Studio, a latest Azure service can be used as a tool to implement Chaos engineering.\n \nWhy reliability?\nDesigning an application in cloud must meet certain architectural guidelines to operate effectively.
