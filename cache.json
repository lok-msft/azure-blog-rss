Or have you already built a web app with Python, but wondered how you can deploy it online? If so, you might be interested in watching this video by and Pamela Fox and Renee Noble, two Python Cloud Advocates at Microsoft with a passion for web development and education!\n \nThey’ll show you how to create a web app with Python Flask (or it’s async-sibling Quart) and show you how you can deploy you can take your web app live by deploying it on Azure. This is the first episode in this live stream series (which you can also catch on demand!) by Pamela and friends covering different web dev frameworks and practices! (And you can catch it in Spanish too!)\n\n\n\n \nIn this video, you will learn how the web works and why you (likely) need a web server to serve up your web app. You will also discover how a backend web framework, like Flask, helps you develop your web server quickly and easily and how it lets you use templates to build dynamic sites - whether it’s your first site or a complex full-scale service.\n \nWant to improve your web server throughput? Find out how you can port your app to Quart, the asynchronous version of Flask. And of course, you’ll see how you can deploy your web apps to Azure App Service in minutes and learn what other deployment options you might be interested in seeking out depending on your project.\n \nThe video is perfect for beginners who have some familiarity with Python, but no prior experience with web development or deployment. It is also suitable for intermediate or advanced developers who want to refresh their skills or learn new tricks. Take a look at the video to learn some concepts and follow along with our coding and deployment demos! You can grab the demo repo here and check out the slides too.",

          "description": "Introduction\nData is the power behind human civilization and knowledge. Over the past decades, we have seen an increase in data shared across the internet. With the massive availability of data as well as advanced compute, models were trained to take advantage of the data to process and understand natural language. Models were trained to produce new and original content bringing about Generative AI.\n \nGlobally, developers, data scientists, and engineers created new applications or advanced their existing applications to take advantage of LLMs. While building a Question-and-Answer chatbot is simple and you may not need advanced tools, in other more complex scenarios, the AI orchestrator come in and make the process easier. At the center of LLM applications is the AI orchestration layer that…",

No te preocupes, aquí te hacemos un resumen y te compartimos el video y algunos recursos para que puedas seguir aprendiendo.\n \nContenido\n\n\nBruno Capuano mostró cómo cambiar entre modelos locales y en la nube con semantic kernel. 3:40\n\n\nFrancis Nicole mostró cómo usar Custom Vision para entrenar un modelo de detección de imágenes con un personaje de dibujos animados, usando Language Studio y Azure portal. También explicó las métricas de rendimiento y los resultados del modelo. 10:47\n\n\nPablo Di Loreto presentó algunos servicios de Azure AI que no son generativos, pero útiles para el procesamiento de lenguaje natural y la IA conversacional, como análisis de texto, extracción de frases clave y respuesta a preguntas personalizadas. También demostró cómo usar Language Studio y Azure Bot Service para crear un chatbot con preguntas frecuentes. 21:21\n\n\nLuis Beltrán explicó cómo usar Azure Functions y SQL para crear un motor de búsqueda de productos basado en embeddings. También mostró cómo usar Azure OpenAI para generar embeddings y Azure Communication Services para conectar con WhatsApp. 33:17\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\n \nRecursos\nLos materiales están disponibles en este link: https://www.theurlist.com/ainetlatam03\n \nSaludos\nBruno Capuano",

We also answered some of the questions that you asked us in the previous episode, such as:\n\nHow to work with local models\nHow to use semantic kernel\nHow to evaluate different models.\n\n \nOne of the main topics that we discussed was the AI samples repo, where we are adding artificial intelligence samples for .NET developers. You can find scenarios such as text summarization, chat, data generation, image generation, and more. You can also choose between using semantic kernel or the Azure Open AI SDK to interact with the models.\n \nWe also showed you how to switch between different models, such as GPT-4, Phi-3 and Llama, using the same code and API. We also shared some links to other resources, such as the Azure Developer .NET Day, where you can learn more about AI, GitHub Copilot, SQL Server, and other topics.\n \nAnother topic that we covered was the model evaluation sample, which is a work in progress that we are going to present at Build 2024.  (you can check the PR here). The idea behind this sample is to help you evaluate different models that you may want to use or fine-tune for your own applications. We showed you how to use a console application that uses semantic kernel to generate questions and answers, user stories, and other inputs, and then evaluate them using different metrics, such as coherence, groundedness, relevance, and length.\n \nThe full recording is here, \n\n\n\nCheck the next sessions here: .NET Live. \n \nBest,\nBruno",

We write tests, like unit tests, integration tests, smoke tests, accessibility tests, loadtests, property-based tests. We can’t automate all forms of testing, so we test what we can, and hire humans to audit what we can’t.\n \nBut when we’re building RAG chat apps built on LLMs, we need to introduce an entirely new form of testing to give us confidence that our LLM responses are coherent, grounded, and well-formed.\n \nWe call this form of testing “evaluation”, and we can now automate it with the help of the most powerful LLM in town: GPT-4.\n \nHow to evaluate a RAG chat app\n \nThe general approach is:\n\nGenerate a set of “ground truth” …",

If you only use your own tool chain in the AI agent framework to solve enterprise workflow, it will be very limited. AutoGen supports defining tool chains through Function Calling, and developers can define different methods to assemble extended business work chains.

You can create and run load tests, analyze and compare the results, and define test fail criteria based on metrics like response time, error percentage, and throughput.\nResponse time is the time your application takes to respond to a user request. It depends on factors like network latency, server load, and application logic. To measure the performance of your application, you need to look at the response time distribution across different percentiles, which show how many requests are completed within a certain time limit.

You can now easily monitor your Python apps on App Service without changing your code by leveraging auto-instrumentation that is integrated into the App Services platform.\n \nThis integration supports App Service deploy as code for Python versions 3.11 and lower. Deploy as container scenarios are not currently supported, but we plan to introduce this capability at a future date. We also plan to support Python 3.12 in the near future.\n \nWith this feature enabled, the App Service platform will instrument popular Python libraries in your code and automatically channel correlated application-level logs, metrics, and distributed tracing to your Application Insights resource. This will allow you to understand how your Python application is performing and more easily determine the cause of any incidents.\n \nYou can enable the feature at resource creation or from the App Insights blade after your App Service resource is created. Please review our documentation to learn more.\n \nTurn On App Insights during App Service Resource Creation\n \nWhen you create a new Python web application (version 3.11 and lower) using the \"Deploy as code\" option, you can select \"Yes\" on the \"Enable Application Insights\" in the \"Monitoring\" tab. If you select \"Yes\", then your non-containerized Python application will pipe data to an Application Insights resource allowing you to automatically monitor your workloads.\n \n\n \n \nTurn On App Insights after App Service Resource Creation\n \nOpen your App Service application in the portal and go to the App Insights menu item.\n\nSelect \"Enable\" in the toggle under \"Application Insights (Preview)\"\nSelect a location for your Application Insights resource (It’s suggested to create the resource in the same region as the Web App.)",

          "description": "Microsoft is looking to enable TLS 1.3 for Azure Service Bus, and Azure Event Hubs.  We found however that there is a problem with some clients that use both Java and our AMQP or JMS interfaces.  Java clients that use Apache Proton-J with a version older than proton-j-0.31.0 along with Java 11+ can't support TLS 1.3.  The Proton-J library is used in AMQP and JMS implementations. The nature of the problem lies in the handshake and is thus not detectable by our application layer.  This means that we can't detect and work around the issue from the service side.  To avoid this problem, customers need to update any instances of Apache Proton-J that have a version older than proton-j-0.31.0.  The link for the Proton-J issue is tracked at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PROTON-1972\n \nRequired action\nProton-J may also be in a dependent library and may not be directly used by your code. To determine if you have an incompatibility with TLS 1.3, we have enabled the West Central US region with TLS 1.3 support for AMQP traffic.  To test if you have a compatibility issue\n\nfirst evaluate if you are using AMQP or JMS\nSecond, determine if you are using Java 11+ with your client code\nThird, if you are using AMQP or JMS and also Java 11+, then create a namespace in West Central US and attempt to connect to it with your code. \n\nIf your client fails to connect, you need to find where you are using Proton-J and get the version used updated to a version that is newer than proton-j-0.30.0.\n \nTimeline\nAs already noted, this only affects AMQP or JMS traffic.  It does not affect web service or Kafka traffic which does have TLS 1.3 enabled now.  We are going to enable TLS 1.3 for AMQP and JMS on October 31, 2024.  That is also the same day that TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 is being removed from Azure Event Hubs and Azure Service Bus.  Please take action as soon as possible to guarantee no interruption to your service use when we enable TLS 1.3.",

          "description": "A very common task for Microsoft Fabric, Azure Data Factory and Synapse Analytics Pipelines is to receive unstructured files, land them in an Azure Data Lake (ADLS Gen2) and load them into structured tables. This often leads to a very common issue with unstructured files when “SOMETHING HAS CHANGED” and the unstructured file does not meet the defined table format. If issues are not handled properly within the pipeline, the data workloads will fail and users will be asking \"WHERE'S MY DATA???\" You then need to communicate with the owner of the file, have them fix the issues, then rerun the pipeline after the issues have been fixed. Along with unhappy users, rerunning failed pipelines adds cost. Validating these files before they are processed allows your pipelines to continue ingesting file…",

Advanced Network Observability is the inaugural feature of the ACNS suite bringing the power of Hubble’s control plane to both Cilium and Non-Cilium Linux data planes. With Advanced Network Observability, customers can now pinpoint network-related issues with more precision and detect root causes faster.  The offering provides pod level packet statistics, DNS statistics, L4 connections and enhanced debugging capabilities with network flow logs and DNS error tracking.\nData flow for Advanced Network Observability\n \nHow can Azure customers use the new offering?\nACNS is integrated deeply with existing Azure Monitor capabilities for monitoring AKS clusters. Using the new capabilities requires no extra configuration from customers. Customers can enable advanced network observability with a single command. The metrics are then ingested automatically by Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus. Additionally, customers can visualize the metrics in pre-built dashboards in Azure Managed Grafana. Customers have access to 6 pre-built dashboards in Azure Managed Grafana covering a breadth of signals from cluster traffic to DNS and pod level flows.\n \nPod flows dashboard built into Azure Manged Grafana\n \n \nHow to get ACNS\nTo get started with ACNS capabilities, please see our onboarding documentation\n \nRead more about ACNS:\n\nDocumentation: What is Advanced Container Networking Services?\nAzure Blog:  Announcing Advanced Container Networking Services for your Azure Kubernetes Service clusters",

Success hinges on visibility, and that’s true whether you’re operating on Azure, on-premise, or at the edge. As organizations scale their infrastructures and applications, the volume of observability data naturally increases. This surge can complicate the management of networking, data storage and ingestion, often forcing a trade-off between cost management and observability.\n \nThe complexity doesn’t end there. The very tools designed to ingest, process, and route this data can be both costly and complex, adding layers of operational challenges. Moreover, edge infrastructure is deployed near IoT devices for optimal data processing, high availability, and reduced lat…",

If your data is bad, the outputs won't be good. The short version of this is Garbage in - Garbage out which is definitely shorter and easier to remember. A good prompt is often the key for a good answer.

This also helps with auto mapping, when the sink column names do not come with spaces!\n \nSelect transformation in data flow makes it simpler to automatically detect spaces in column names and then remove them for the rest of the dataflow.\n \nConsider the below source, with the given column names.\n \n\n \nHere as we can see, few columns have spaces, few columns like Region and Country do not have spaces in it. \n \nUsing the below configuration in select transformation, we can get rid of the spaces in the column names with a simple expression. \n \nIn the Input columns, Click on Add mapping button, and choose Rule-based Mapping.\n\nThen give the below expression:\non Source1's column: true()\non Name as column: replace($$,' ','')\n \n\nWhat it does? \nIt will return true() for all the columns which have ' ' (space) in it and replace it with '' (no space).\nUpon data preview, we get to see the below result,\n \n\n \nAs we are seeing here, all the columns with spaces are coming without spaces in between. \nIf not for the Rule based mapping, one would have to manually remove space from all the columns.

Advanced Network Observability is the inaugural feature of the ACNS suite bringing the power of Hubble’s control plane to both Cilium and Non-Cilium Linux data planes. With Advanced Network Observability, customers can now pinpoint network-related issues with more precision and detect root causes faster.  The offering provides pod level packet statistics, DNS statistics, L4 connections and enhanced debugging capabilities with network flow logs and DNS error tracking.\nData flow for Advanced Network Observability\n \nHow can Azure customers use the new offering?\nACNS is integrated deeply with existing Azure Monitor capabilities for monitoring AKS clusters. Using the new capabilities requires no extra configuration from customers. Customers can enable advanced network observability with a single command. The metrics are then ingested automatically by Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus. Additionally, customers can visualize the metrics in pre-built dashboards in Azure Managed Grafana. Customers have access to 6 pre-built dashboards in Azure Managed Grafana covering a breadth of signals from cluster traffic to DNS and pod level flows.\n \nPod flows dashboard built into Azure Manged Grafana\n \n \nHow to get ACNS\nTo get started with ACNS capabilities, please see our onboarding documentation\n \nRead more about ACNS:\n\nDocumentation: What is Advanced Container Networking Services?\nAzure Blog:  Announcing Advanced Container Networking Services for your Azure Kubernetes Service clusters",

The original instance of your workspace is referred to as the primary workspace, and the replica on the second region is referred to as secondary.\nThe second instance of your workspace is created by the service with the same ID and configuration as your primary workspace (future configuration changes you make will be synced as well).
