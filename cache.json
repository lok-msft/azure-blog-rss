Traditional documentation generators like Pydoc rely on predefined rules and in-line code information. However, emerging generative AI techniques, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), offer new possibilities for enhanced documentation generation. Developed in partnership with Microsoft and UCL, DocAider aims to create an AI-powered documentation tool that automatically generates and updates code documentation. The tool leverages Github Actions workflows to trigger documentation tasks upon pull requests (PRs) opening, providing valuable insights into continuous documentation maintenance.

We’ll show you how to combine the Phi-3 language model, Local Embeddings, and Semantic Kernel to create a RAG scenario.\nWhat is RAG?\nBefore we dive into the demo, let’s quickly recap what RAG is. RAG is a hybrid approach that enhances the capabilities of a language model by incorporating external knowledge. In example: using a RAG approach we can retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base and use them to generate more informed and accurate responses. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a LLM needs up-to-date information or specific domain knowledge that isn't contained within its initial training data.\nThe Components\nTo build our RAG setup, we’ll be using th…",

Or have you already built a web app with Python, but wondered how you can deploy it online? If so, you might be interested in watching this video by and Pamela Fox and Renee Noble, two Python Cloud Advocates at Microsoft with a passion for web development and education!\n \nThey’ll show you how to create a web app with Python Flask (or it’s async-sibling Quart) and show you how you can deploy you can take your web app live by deploying it on Azure. This is the first episode in this live stream series (which you can also catch on demand!) by Pamela and friends covering different web dev frameworks and practices! (And you can catch it in Spanish too!)\n\n\n\n \nIn this video, you will learn how the web works and why you (likely) need a web server to serve up your web app. You will also discover how a backend web framework, like Flask, helps you develop your web server quickly and easily and how it lets you use templates to build dynamic sites - whether it’s your first site or a complex full-scale service.\n \nWant to improve your web server throughput? Find out how you can port your app to Quart, the asynchronous version of Flask. And of course, you’ll see how you can deploy your web apps to Azure App Service in minutes and learn what other deployment options you might be interested in seeking out depending on your project.\n \nThe video is perfect for beginners who have some familiarity with Python, but no prior experience with web development or deployment. It is also suitable for intermediate or advanced developers who want to refresh their skills or learn new tricks. Take a look at the video to learn some concepts and follow along with our coding and deployment demos! You can grab the demo repo here and check out the slides too.",

          "description": "Overcoming Asymmetrical Routing in Azure Virtual WAN: A Collaborative Journey\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of cloud networking, professionals often encounter complex challenges that demand innovative solutions. This blog post delves into a recent scenario involving Azure Virtual WAN (VWAN), where a team embarked on a collaborative journey to address asymmetrical routing issues. This case study not only highlights the technical intricacies but also underscores the importance of collaboration and knowledge sharing in the tech community.\n\n \n \nThe Challenge:\nThe core issue revolved around asymmetrical routing within an Azure VWAN architecture, which included two hubs located in different regions. The primary goal was to ensure seamless connectivity between a Palo Alto NGFW in one hub and Panorama in another, without disrupting the existing VPN default routes. The asymmetry in routing was particularly problematic for traffic intended to reach Panorama from the NGFW, as the return traffic defaulted through the VPN, deviating from the desired path.\n\nThe configuration issue with the firewall is acknowledged as a known issue. The only mitigation provided is documented in Microsoft's official documentation. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/whats-new#known-issues\n\n \n\n \nPossible solutions:\n\nExposing the Panorama to the public IP and creating a relay subnet for routing / advertising summary route from NCUS to SCUS for NCUS subnet (10.193.0.0/16)",

Administrators or developers can then use these dumps to pinpoint the cause of the spikes. This guide will walk you through collecting a memory dump using Procdump.exe for applications hosted on App Service (Windows).\n \n\nAccess the Azure Portal and navigate to the desired App Service.\nClick on \"Advanced Tools\" and then \"Go ->\" to access the SCM/Kudu site.\n\n\n \n\nOn the SCM site, go to Process Explorer to find the PID of the w3wp.exe process, which is the application worker process.\n\n\n \n\nUse the Debug console to open the CMD option.\n\n\n \n\nNavigate to the System Drive and access the sysinternals path:\n\nC:\\devtools\\sysinternals>\nNote: The drive letter may vary (e.g., D:\\ or C:)\n\n\n\n \n\nLocate the procdump.exe file in the sysinternals directory, which will be used for running commands.\nTo collect logs for the application worker process, use the PID obtained earlier.\nUse the following command to collect a full memory dump.\n\nProcdump.exe -accepteula -ma [PID] [Path]\n\nPath: Specifies the directory where the collected memory dump file will be stored.\n\n\nExample: procdump.exe -accepteula -ma 5100 C:\\dumps\\\n\n\n\n \n\nInitiate the dump collection and reproduce the issue the application is facing.\n\n\n \n\nAfter the memory dump collection is complete, access the specific path on the SCM site to download the collected memory dump.\n\n\n\n \nYou can consult the following article for further details on Procdump commands and various parameters to utilize depending on your specific needs and troubleshooting scenario.\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump\n \nIt's advisable to gather multiple sets of memory dumps because analyzing several dumps can reveal patterns and facilitate the development of an action plan to resolve issues effectively.",

To use granular permissions, you need to use Microsoft Entra authentication, and assign one of the following roles, either on the namespace level or on the entity level.\n\nService Bus Data Owner; Allows to execute both send and receive operations.\nService Bus Data Sender; Allows to execute send operations.\nService Bus Data Receiver; Allows to execute peek, receive, and purge operations.\n\nIn case you use a role which doesn’t have send or receive permissions, or you do not have permissions on the specific entity, the unavailable operations will be disabled.

This approach is particularly beneficial because it allows the model to understand and adapt to new tasks with minimal data, making it highly efficient and versatile. By leveraging few-shot prompts, users can achieve high-quality results without the need for extensive training datasets, thus saving time and computational resources. Additionally, this method enhances the model’s ability to generalize from limited examples, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.\n \nOne challenge of using few-shot prompts is that as the number of examples increases, the prompt can become exce…",

          "description": "Last year at BUILD we announced the public preview of the Network Observability add-on. Today we’re excited to share a massive upgrade to the network observability capabilities available to AKS customers. \n \nWhat’s new?\nWe are excited to announce Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS), a suite of services built to significantly enhance the operational capabilities of your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. Advanced Network Observability is the inaugural feature of the ACNS suite bringing the power of Hubble’s control plane to both Cilium and Non-Cilium Linux data planes. With Advanced Network Observability, customers can now pinpoint network-related issues with more precision and detect root causes faster.  The offering provides pod level packet statistics, DNS statistics, L4 connections and enhanced debugging capabilities with network flow logs and DNS error tracking.\nData flow for Advanced Network Observability\n \nHow can Azure customers use the new offering?\nACNS is integrated deeply with existing Azure Monitor capabilities for monitoring AKS clusters. Using the new capabilities requires no extra configuration from customers. Customers can enable advanced network observability with a single command. The metrics are then ingested automatically by Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus. Additionally, customers can visualize the metrics in pre-built dashboards in Azure Managed Grafana. Customers have access to 6 pre-built dashboards in Azure Managed Grafana covering a breadth of signals from cluster traffic to DNS and pod level flows.\n \nPod flows dashboard built into Azure Manged Grafana\n \n \nHow to get ACNS\nTo get started with ACNS capabilities, please see our onboarding documentation\n \nRead more about ACNS:\n\nDocumentation: What is Advanced Container Networking Services?\nAzure Blog:  Announcing Advanced Container Networking Services for your Azure Kubernetes Service clusters",

In addition to providing a stronger security posture, this strategy is also in compliance with major data regulations like GDPR, FERPA and PCI-DSS. In this article, we’ll explore how CSE can provide superior protection for your data, particularly if an authentication and authorization account is compromised. We’ll also address common questions about Microsoft's stance on CSE and explain why CSE might not be as widely discussed as Client-Side Key Encryption (CSKE).

          "description": "The article discusses a problem where numerous messages end up in the dead letter queue (DLQ) when the JMS service bus consumer connects to the Azure Service Bus using Qpid jars. The reason for the messages being dead-lettered is that they have reached the maximum delivery count.\n \nThe fundamental issue stems from Apache Qpid's message handling. Qpid utilizes a local buffer to prefetch messages from the Azure Service Bus, storing them prior to delivery to the consumer. The complication occurs when Qpid prefetches an excessive number of messages that the consumer is unable to process within the lock duration. Consequently, the consumer is unable to acknowledge or finalize the processing of these messages before the lock expires, leading to an accumulation of messages in the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).\n \nTo address this problem, it is crucial to either turn off Qpid's local buffer or modify the prefetch count. Disabling prefetching is achievable by setting jms.prefetchPolicy.all=0 in the JMS client. This configuration allows the JMS client to directly consume messages from the Azure Service Bus, circumventing Qpid's local buffer. Consequently, the consumer can process messages at a suitable pace, guaranteeing smooth processing and issue-free completion.\n \nWhy is Prefetch not the default option in Microsoft .NET/Java/Python libs?",

Data transmission and access control are critical aspects of security that need to be considered. SSH tunneling is a technique that can help achieve secure communication between different components of an application or solution. SSH tunneling creates an encrypted channel over an existing SSH connection, allowing secure data transmission between a local machine (SSH client) and a remote server (SSH server).\nIn this article, we will show how to set up SSH tunneling between containers running in the cloud that need to communicate with downstream resources via an SSH server hosted in a cloud VM.\n \nSSH Tunneling\nBefore diving into the implementation, let’s have a quick refresher about S…",

          "description": "Enhancing Disaster Recovery and Ransomware Protection with Azure VMware Solution and JetStream Software\n \nDisaster Recovery (DR) and ransomware protection are critical concerns for organizations today, as the frequency and cost of attacks continue to rise. Our customers demand comprehensive and cost-effective options to safeguard their critical workloads without compromising application performance.\n \nAVS collaborates with leading technology companies, such as JetStream Software, to deliver advanced DR solutions that offer both near-zero Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) and near-zero Recovery Time Objective (RTO) options. The JetStream DR and Ransomware solution implements Continuous Data Protection (CDP) by immediately replicating all data generated by protected VMs. It employs heuristic algorithms to detect data tampering by utilizing cost-effective and high-performance storage options like Azure Blob Storage, Azure NetApp Files (ANF), and ESAN-based solutions. Utilizing the VMware-certified VAIO APIs means that the JetStream solution is fully VMware Ready certified. This approach is unique compared to other market offerings that provide DR protection by creating intermittent snapshots.\n \nJetStream has also partnered with Microsoft to develop a unique feature that rehydrates VMs and their data from Azure Blob object storage, deploying them to AVS nodes provisioned on-demand, to a pilot light cluster in AVS. This ensures a rapid and cost-controlled recovery that minimizes downtime in the event of a disaster or ransomware attack.\n \nTo learn more about the power of this integration, watch our sessions at VMware Explore 2024 in Las Vegas:\n\n“Future-Proof VMware Workloads with Azure VMware Solution” [Session ID: VCFB2530LVS]\n“Implementing a Robust BCDR Plan with Azure VMware Solution” [Session ID: VCFB2534LVS]\n“Discover the Partner Ecosystem for Azure VMware Solution” [Session ID: VCFB2532LVS]",
