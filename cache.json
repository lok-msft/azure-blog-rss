          "description": "A Java dependency version conflict occurs when two or more dependencies in your project have incompatible versions of the same class or resource. This can cause runtime errors, unexpected behavior, or compilation failures in your Java application. Sometimes it is hard to detect them, while with the help of IDEA Maven Helper, it has never been so simple.\n \n1. Install the plugin\nIn IntelliJ IDEA, choose File -> Settings -> Plugins. Within the Marketplace tab, search for Maven Helper and click Install.\n\n \n2. Leverage the plugin\nOpen the pom.xml file of your project and switch to the Dependency Analyzer tab at the bottom.\n\nYou will see three options: Conflicts, All Dependencies as List, and All Dependencies as Tree. Choose Conflicts to see if there are any dependency conflicts in your project.\n\n \n3. Resolve conflict\nTo resolve a conflict, you can right-click on a dependency on the left panel and choose Exclude. This will add an exclusion tag to your pom.xml file and remove the dependency from your project. Alternatively, you can also choose a compatible version of the dependency that works with all other dependencies and declare it explicitly in your pom.xml file using the dependencyManagement section.\nAfter resolving a conflict, you can refresh the Dependency Analyzer tab to see if there are any remaining conflicts. You can also use the All Dependencies as List or All Dependencies as Tree options to see all the dependencies in your project in different formats.\n\n \n4. Conclusion\nDependency conflicts can be difficult to detect, but they can cause a lot of problems in the project. By using the above-mentioned technique and following best practices to prevent dependency conflicts, you can ensure your application runs smoothly without any issues.\nReferences:Troubleshoot dependency version conflicts when using the Azure SDK for Java | Microsoft Learn Maven – Introduction to the Dependency Mechanism (apache.org)",

By default, the front-end’s OS would pick the most secure cipher suite that is supported by both the front-end and the client. However, if the client only supports weak cipher suites, then the front-end’s OS would pick a weak cipher suite that they both support.\nApp Service does SSL termination on the Frontend layer, which happens before the frontend instances forward requests to workers.

          "description": "There are multiple ways to increase the concurrency of python function app. I drew an architecture diagram, which can give us an overall understanding of the function app.\n \n\nBased on the diagram, we can see we could increase function app concurrency by increasing instance count, python worker count and thread count. To better understand this, I build several labs to validate this. I will not demonstrate instance count as it is easy to understand. All these labs are having 4 concurrent incoming requests and each request takes 10 seconds to complete.\n \nLab1:\ncode:\nsync\n\nConfiguration:\nmaxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=1\nResult:\nIt took 40 seconds to complete the 4 executions. We can see these 4 executions were triggered at the same time, this is because the function host level is using async. But actually these executions are executed one by one.\n\nLab2:\ncode: The same as Lab1.\nConfiguration:\nmaxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=2\nResult:\nIt took 20 seconds to complete the 4 executions.\n\n \nLab3:\ncode: The same as Lab1.\nConfiguration:\nmaxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=2PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=2\nResult:\nIt took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.\n\nLab4:\ncode:\nasync\n\nConfiguration:\nmaxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=1\nResult:\nIt took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.\n\n \nConclusion:\n1.We can increase the concurrency by increasing FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT and PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT. Just note that we can configure the concurrent setting in host.json file. This is the bottleneck of the concurrency. \n2.It is more recommended to use async method instead of sync method as async has better performance than sync with the same configuration.\n \nReference link:\nAzure Functions HTTP triggers and bindings | Microsoft Learn\nImprove throughput performance of Python apps in Azure Functions | Microsoft Learn",

          "description": "As a PHP developer, sometimes you might want to set the custom configuration file (.ini) to read when PHP starts up. For this article, I would like demonstrate how to load custom configuration file (.ini) in the Azure App Service.\n \nBy default, we set the PHP_INI_DIR = /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d, so when using SSH on Kudu, you could see there are lots of .ini files:\n\n \nBased on this, you might think we could just manually add our custom .ini files in /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d, but it will not work after restart. Since only \"/home\" data will be persistent after restarting App Service. So what we need to do is to add our .ini in \"/home\", E.g. \"/home/site/ini\"\n \nFor example, if I would like to modify \"upload_max_filesize to 64M (defualt is 2M) and post_max_size to 64M (default is 8M)\" for the PHP website, I could follow the below steps to achieve it:\n \nStep 1:\nUse like vi/vim command to add setting.ini file in the \"/home/site/ini\" folder\n\n \nStep 2:\nPHP supports scanning multiple directories for .ini files. For this we need to set PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR with \":\" to separate values on the Application Setting for the target App Service.\nE.g. PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR = :/home/site/ini\nThis ensures that we load *.ini files from  /usr/local/etc/php and then load from /home/site/ini\n\n \n \nAfter, we check the value by simple php page and it will show upload_max_size and post_max_size are set as 64M now.\n\n \nReference:\n\nUnderstanding the Azure App Service file system: Understanding the Azure App Service file system · projectkudu/kudu Wiki · GitHub\nConfigure a PHP app for Azure App Service: Configure PHP apps - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn",

          "description": "Azure Static Web App offers two types of preview environments: branch environment and named environment. Both of these methods offer isolated environments for testing and deploying changes to your Azure Static Web App, allowing you to test and validate changes without affecting the main production environment.\n \nHere are the steps to create a preview environment:\n \n1. After deploying the production branch to the main site, create a new branch based on the main branch and name it \"dev\".\n\n\n \n2. Modify your YAML file in the dev branch to include \"dev\" in the trigger to track any changes in the dev branch.\n\n \n3. Set \"production_branch\" to the name of your production branch. This action will ensure the deploy task in the dev branch creates a new preview environment.\n\n \n4. Save the changes and after deployment, you can see a new environment named 'dev' for the dev branch.\n\n \n5. If you want to name a preview environment separately (instead of using the branch name), set the \"deployment_environment\" to the desired name, and it will create a named environment.\n\n \n\n \nThe main difference between branch and named environments is that branch environments are created automatically based on the branch name, whereas named environments are custom-named. \n \nOverall, both branch and named environments provide isolated environments for testing and deploying changes to your Azure Static Web App, allowing you to test and validate changes without affecting the main production environment. The choice of environment type typically depends on the specific needs and development process of your project.",

          "description": "Encrypting data at rest is a primary step in securing a Kubernetes cluster. KMS provides an interface for a provider to utilize a key stored in an external key service to perform this encryption. While KMS v1 on AKS enabled the encryption of Kubernetes secrets using a key in Azure Key Vault, it was limited to only supporting encryption of 2000 secrets. To address this limitation, the Azure Container Upstream team, in collaboration with the Kubernetes community, spearheaded the enhancement project. After being part of two Kubernetes releases, this feature has graduated to beta in Kubernetes v1.27. As soon as KMS v2 became beta in v1.27, Microsoft promptly made it available on AKS as one of many security enhancement features available to its users. For a full list of KMSv2 enhancements, check out this Kubernetes blog post.\nFor clusters at version v1.27+ with KMS newly enabled, KMS v2 is configured by default. However, for clusters with KMS enabled at versions below v1.27, upgrading to v1.27 will be blocked . To upgrade, follow the steps outlined in this documentation for migrating from KMS v1 to v2, and then proceed with upgrading the cluster to version v1.27. Running your v1.27 AKS cluster with KMS v2 feature enabled, you can now encrypt more than 2000 secrets.",

It is the next evolution of a public preview feature in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), that is built on the now deprecated pod identity project. Azure AD Workload Identity, is simpler to use and replaces pod identity. Azure AD Workload Identity on AKS is now generally available so customers can run production workloads using Workload Identity on both Windows and Linux and migrate applications using Pod Identity over to Workload Identity. \n \nAzure AD Workload Identity leverages Service Account Token Volume Projection giving pods the ability to use a Kubernetes identity (service account), to which a Kubernetes token is issued and OIDC federation which enables Kubernetes applications to access Azure cloud resources securely with Azure Active Directory based on annotated service accounts.\n \nSince the open-source pod identity project is now deprecated, AKS will continue to support the AKS pod identity through 2023. To ease the transition, customers can run Pod Identity and Workload Identity in parallel on an existing AKS cluster.  Please note that during the Public Preview we enabled the sidecar to give customers time to update their SDKs, but this is not a supported configuration for General Availability. We recommend that customers update applications to a list of supported SDKs that will allow applications to talk to the AAD endpoint.",

With workloads configured to consume only the necessary resources and dynamically scale to meet demand, businesses can optimize resource usage while reducing downtime. Additionally, Kubernetes allows organizations to deploy multiple applications from various teams or business units to a single cluster, resulting in significantly reduced infrastructure costs. However, this multitenancy approach poses a new challenge.\n \nConsider this scenario: your cluster generates $100/day in infrastructure spend with a shared set of resources split across 10 developer teams. If 1 team consumes 80% of the cluster’s resources, it does not make sense to split infrastructure costs evenly across all teams at $10/day. Instead, your organ…",

You can use system-assigned or user-assigned managed identities with Event Hubs capturing destinations.\nManaged identities provide an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure AD authentication. Applications can use managed identities to obtain Azure AD tokens without having to manage any credentials.\n\n \nIn the context of Event Hubs capture feature, these manage identities are used to authenticate and authorize the event capturing agent with the capture destinations such as Azure Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen1 or Gen2.\nWhen configuring event capturing for a given event hub/Kafka topic, users can enable capture and select system assigned or user assigned identity as the authentication mode.\n\n \nEvent Hubs Capture feature also supports capturing data to a capture destination in a different subscription with the use of managed identity.\n \nNext steps\nIn conclusion, the introduction of managed identity support for event stream capturing in Event Hubs marks a significant expansion of our event streaming and storing capabilities. Now you can experience the power of secure stream capture and unleash the full potential of your event-driven architecture with Event Hubs.\nTo learn more about Event Hubs capture feature, see Capture streaming events - Azure Event Hubs.",

While LLMs come with a vast amount of knowledge already, this knowledge is limited and not tailored to specific use-cases.

As a first step, this service is fully integrated with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as an add-on which scrapes Prometheus metrics.\n \nTo integrate KEDA into your Azure Kubernetes Service, you will need to deploy and configure a workload identity or pod identity on your cluster. This identity allows KEDA to authenticate with Azure and retrieve metrics for scaling from your Monitor workspace.\n \nWe recommend using Azure Active Directory workload identity. This authentication method replaces pod-managed identity (pod-managed identity in AKS has been deprecated as of 10/24/2022), which integrates with the Kubernetes native capabilities to federate with any external identity providers on behalf of the application.\n \nAzure Managed Prometheus support starts from KEDA v2.10. If you have an older version of KEDA installed, you must upgrade in order to work with Azure Managed Prometheus.\n \nTo integrate KEDA into your AKS, please start with our documentation, and reach out to us should you have any feedback or questions!",

          "description": "We’re excited to let you know that Azure Monitor – Container Insights now supports multiline logging! With this feature enabled, previously split container logs are stitched together and sent as single entries to the ContainerLogV2 table. Customers are able see container log lines up to 64 KB (up from the existing 16 KB limit). If the stitched log line is larger than 64 KB, it gets truncated due to Log Analytics limits. This feature enables the customers to directly consume the logs in meaningful ways without having to spend time stitching them with custom Kusto queries. Additionally, the feature also adds support for .NET and Go stack traces, which appear as single entries instead of being split into multiple entries in ContainerLogV2 table.\n \nWhy this is important:\nLogs are an essential part of monitoring and troubleshooting applications running in containers. However, when logs are split across multiple lines, it can be challenging to consume them effectively. View the example of Multi-Line below:\n \nMulti-Line Disabled\n\n \nMulti-Line Enabled\n\n \n \nTo enable multi-line logging:\n1. Make sure agent is updated to version 3.1.6 or later\n2. Customers must enable ContainerLogV2 for multi-line logging to work. Go to the ConfigMap to enable ContainerLogV2 in Container Insights.\n\n3. Set enable_multiline_logs flag to “true” in the config map.\n\n4. Apply the ConfigMap:\nkubectl apply -f container-azm-ms-agentconfig.yaml\n \nNext steps for multi-line logging:\nRead more about the ContainerLogV2 schema here.\n \nPlease share any feedback for this feature using this form: https://forms.office.com/r/FCDvikMZ0S",

Now with Visual Studio 17.7, you can try out pre-caching for yourself on Microsoft Dev Box.\n \nVisual Studio utilizes many caches to increase the performance of key features like Find in Files and IntelliSense. When opening a solution for the first time these caches must be generated by indexing and processing the codebase. Working with large solutions can add a significant amount of time to startup while these caches are created. Once the caches are created Visual Studio can quickly use these features.\n \nWith Microsoft Dev Box we create ready-to-code development desktops in the cloud. This …",

Previously, the only way you could use dev tunnels was through Visual Studio 2022.\n \nToday, we are thrilled to announce the public preview of the devtunnel CLI! To create, host, and connect to your first dev tunnel in seconds, please follow the documentation on Microsoft Learn.\n \n\n \nUse cases\nHere are some of the scenarios that dev tunnels enable with the devtunnel CLI or dev tunnels in Visual Studio 2022.\n\nTest an app with external services. For instance, test and debug Power Platform connectors, Azure Communication Services APIs, or Twilio webhooks.\nTest and debug a web app on other devices, like mobile phones and tablets.\nMake an app temporarily available to others to review your work in progress on a web app or API.\n\nBenefits\n\nSecure by default – Each dev tunnel you create is only accessible to you using your Microsoft, Microsoft Azure Active Directory or GitHub account.\nPersistent URLs - Retain the same tunnel URL for extended periods of time.\nSupport for multiple simultaneous ports - Host multiple ports on a single tunnel at the same time.\nGlobal service availability - The dev tunnels service is available globally. Tunnels are automatically created in the closest available region to ensure optimal performance.\nTunnel inspection - Inspect tunnel traffic in a familiar interface, browser DevTools, to monitor and manage your web apps or webhooks.\n\nTo improve the devtunnel CLI, we encourage you to connect with us through GitHub issues to request a feature or submit a bug.

The Access Control Lists (ACLs) of your Azure Storage Account assume a pivotal role in establishing permissions for both containers and blobs situated within the storage account. The inheritance of ACLs is already in place for newly generated child items beneath a parent directory. However, it's noteworthy that now you also have the capability to set, update, or remove ACLs recursively for the pre-existing child items of a parent directory, thereby eliminating the need to undertake these operations for each individual child item.\n \nIn this article, I will walk you through the process of setting Azure Storage Account ACLs recursively using three different methods: PowerShell, AZ …",

As a first step, this service is fully integrated with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as an add-on which scrapes Prometheus metrics.\n \nTo integrate KEDA into your Azure Kubernetes Service, you will need to deploy and configure a workload identity or pod identity on your cluster. This identity allows KEDA to authenticate with Azure and retrieve metrics for scaling from your Monitor workspace.\n \nWe recommend using Azure Active Directory workload identity. This authentication method replaces pod-managed identity (pod-managed identity in AKS has been deprecated as of 10/24/2022), which integrates with the Kubernetes native capabilities to federate with any external identity providers on behalf of the application.\n \nAzure Managed Prometheus support starts from KEDA v2.10. If you have an older version of KEDA installed, you must upgrade in order to work with Azure Managed Prometheus.\n \nTo integrate KEDA into your AKS, please start with our documentation, and reach out to us should you have any feedback or questions!",

          "description": "We’re excited to let you know that Azure Monitor – Container Insights now supports multiline logging! With this feature enabled, previously split container logs are stitched together and sent as single entries to the ContainerLogV2 table. Customers are able see container log lines up to 64 KB (up from the existing 16 KB limit). If the stitched log line is larger than 64 KB, it gets truncated due to Log Analytics limits. This feature enables the customers to directly consume the logs in meaningful ways without having to spend time stitching them with custom Kusto queries. Additionally, the feature also adds support for .NET and Go stack traces, which appear as single entries instead of being split into multiple entries in ContainerLogV2 table.\n \nWhy this is important:\nLogs are an essential part of monitoring and troubleshooting applications running in containers. However, when logs are split across multiple lines, it can be challenging to consume them effectively. View the example of Multi-Line below:\n \nMulti-Line Disabled\n\n \nMulti-Line Enabled\n\n \n \nTo enable multi-line logging:\n1. Make sure agent is updated to version 3.1.6 or later\n2. Customers must enable ContainerLogV2 for multi-line logging to work. Go to the ConfigMap to enable ContainerLogV2 in Container Insights.\n\n3. Set enable_multiline_logs flag to “true” in the config map.\n\n4. Apply the ConfigMap:\nkubectl apply -f container-azm-ms-agentconfig.yaml\n \nNext steps for multi-line logging:\nRead more about the ContainerLogV2 schema here.\n \nPlease share any feedback for this feature using this form: https://forms.office.com/r/FCDvikMZ0S",
