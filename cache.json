          "description": "Hot on the heels of Spring Boot 3.0.2, I am excited to announce the 0.3 release of Spring Modulith.\r\nThe release is packed with improvements.\r\nWe have tweaked a couple of things that might require your attention and a couple of adapting changes to your code.\r\nThe most notable changes are:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-114 â We renamed the â¦.modulith.model package to â¦.modulith.core. This primarily affects ApplicationModules. Please adapt your imports accordingly.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-120 â The documentation support now generates diagram files using the *.puml file extension, as suggested by PlantUML. Please adapt your imports accordingly.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-103 â ApplicationModuleInitializer implementations will be triggered upon application startup, in the order following the application module dependency structure (more core ones are invoked first). Also, ApplicationModules exposes a â¦.getComparator() to order Spring beans that way. Note, that this requires the JGraphT library to be on the classpath (automatically pulled in via the spring-modulith-runtime artifact). See the reference documentation for details.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-116 â PublishedEvents now sees events published from asynchronous event listeners, too.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-100 â If youâre using AssertJ in your tests, you can now use AssertablePublishedEvents for a more streamlined integration  (for example, assertThat(events).contains(MyEvent.class).matching(â¦)).\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-117 â As we incentivize event-based, asynchronous application module integration, the test starter now also pulls in Awaitility.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-111 â We now publish aggregated Javdoc.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFind a complete change log in the GitHub release page. We are looking forward to your feedback in the GitHub discussions.",

In contrast to that, upgrading to a new minor or even a new major version requires more work, including code changes to adapt to new or changed APIs, updating configurations to not use deprecated keys anymore, and more.\n\r\nEach new minor or major version of Spring therefore ships with a comprehensive guide and documentation about those changes and you can read and follow to upgrade your project.

Itâs raining outside. Iâm in a warm cozy office. Good music is playing. People are asleep in my home. I can hear the raindrops and wind outside the window. Iâm at peace as I code. And code I have. Iâve been updating my blog, and a half dozen little side projects, to the new Spring Boot 3. This has given me a chance to do a little, shall we say, Spring cleaning, and also update my Github Actions to the latest and greatest. Iâm pleasantly surprised by how many builds Iâve switched over to 3.0 and then used the AOT engine to build a GraalVM native image and it just worked! \n\r\nHow were or are your holidays going?

Starting with version 1.1.x of Spring Cloud Stream until 3.0.0, we provided a schema registry server and AVRO-based schema registry client converters that can reconcile the schema from the schema registry server. Spring Cloud Stream version 3.0.0 moved the Schema Registry components into a top-level spring-cloud project, and Spring Cloud Stream included those in its BOM for the end user applications to consume them. However, this didnât scale well, and with the 3.2 version, we decided to stop having them as part of the Spring Cloud Stream BOM. \n\r\nThe schema registry use caâ¦",

I was just at Devoxx in Belgium, where hundreds of experts from across the Java ecosystem converged for the first time since 2019 to deliver their biggest and best. \n\r\nI could do a proper trip report, but I really just came here to point you to two talks from two of my amazing teammates, StÃ©phane Nicoll (@snicoll) and Brian Clozel (@bclozel), who have been very hard at work on both Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, both of which will land by the end of November, 2022. These are brand new generations of the framework, implying huge new paradigms and new opportunities for developers. \n\r\nThis first is a broader, whirlwind tour of the new features in Spring Framework 6 (which bubble up into Spring Boot 3).\n\r\n\r\nThis second one introduces the new ahead-of-time (AOT) support in Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, which makes it trivial to build GraalVM native images.\n\r\n\n\r\nNB: please ignore the metadata for the YouTube videos. Both talks feature both speakers, and there is no mention whatsoever of React and JavaScript and the like. I think that was a metadata issue with the publication of the videos on YouTube, which will hopefully be resolved. \n\r\nEnjoy! \n\r\nIf you missed this event, thatâs OK - thereâs still time to join the Spring team and larger Java ecosystem for SpringOne, being held 6-8 December, 2022, in sunny San Francisco, CA, 94105!

In our understanding, it is \"how well you can understand the internals of your system by examining its outputs\". We believe that the interconnection between metrics, logging, and distributed tracing gives you the ability to reason about the state of your system in order to debug exceptions and latency in your applications.

          "description": "The year 2022 marked a turning point for GitHub and all its users, with the announcement of the general availability of two revolutionary services for developers: GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Copilot. A Codespace is a development environment hosted in the cloud and accessible via a web browser through one click, with the same graphical interface as the local Visual Studio Code IDE. GitHub Copilot is an AI empowered pair programmer that offers autocomplete-style suggestions as you code in different programming languages (like Python, C++, Javascript and more). But to give you a deeper understanding of what these services are and how you could benefit from them, let me tell you a story, or better two.Â \nÂ \nTraceyâs workshop: a story of a data science workshop speakerÂ \nArtwork created by OpenAIâ¦",

          "description": "Pair programming is a software development technique in which two developers work together on the same code at the same time, with one typing and the other reviewing and offering suggestions. This technique can increase productivity and promote knowledge sharing, as well as improve code quality through increased collaboration and code review.\nTest-driven development (TDD) is a software development process in which tests are written before writing the actual code. The tests serve as a guide for the development process and help ensure that the code meets the requirements and behaves as expected. The TDD cycle consists of writing a test, running it to see if it fails, writing the minimum amount of code needed to make the test pass, and then repeating this process until all tests pass and the â¦",

          "description": "A picture showing .NET\nWhat is .NET MAUI?\n.NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) is a cross-platform framework for creating native mobile and desktop apps with C# and XAML. Using .NET MAUI, you can develop apps that can run on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows from a single shared code-base.\nUsing .NET MAUI, you can create multi-platform apps using a single project, but you can add platform-specific source code and resources if necessary. One of the key aims of .NET MAUI is to enable you to implement as much of your app logic and UI layout as possible in a single code-base.\nÂ \nIn this blog, we will cover how to Build a Water Consumption Mobile App using .NET MAUI that consumes historical data from a Web API. This solution is part of a project build for .NET Conf Student Zone 2022\nÂ \nWhat will we be doing?\nBefore you can get started, we need a few things set up first:\n\nBuild a Mininal API from scratch to consume in your app\nBuild your first .NET MAUI App\nAdd a Consumption.cs class with the following propertiesA picture showing the Consumption.cs class\nAdd a APIManager.cs class to house the HTTP methods for your APIA picture showing the APIManager.cs class\n\nAfter the above are added, you can start to:\n\nConsume A Web API â this will show how you to consume the historical data stored in the Web API and display on your mobile app.\nSend data to your Web API using the HTTP Post Method (shown in the link above too).\n\nÂ \nWe have a dedicated Microsoft learn module that will show you how to Consume and Send Data to your Web API. All of the code for this part of the project and other parts are available on the .NET Student Zone Githup Repositry\nÂ \nTo see and understand the how to implement this in Visual Studio you can watch my session below.\n\nFinally, if you are curious about where the API data comes from, you can explore the other sessions of theÂ .Net Student ConfÂ and understand how all the different pieces and different technologies of .NET ecosystem are combined together into a single e-2-e project.",

In short terms, GitHub is known as the developer's best friend.Â \nAs software and technologies continue to evolve, also Github platform and services are constantly evolving. In this blog post, I wish to show you how the latest Git tools, GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Copilot, can transform and support the world of education.\nÂ \nIn the following video, you'll be listening about two stories, whose scenarios will be familiar to anyone who is studying or teaching at University, or simply anyone who ever learned a new programming language/framework or prepared a hands-on workshop to deliver.Â \nThe first story's character is Ali, a Data Science teacher at the University of Nowhere.Â She is preparing for her spring semester course and in particular, sheâs preparing a guided tutorial, with a full list of all the instructions her students will need to set up the environment for her Python lab.\nThe second story is about Mark. Mark is a student at University of Nowhere. He attended the Python data science lab by prof Ali and now he needs to complete the assignment at home. However, he gets stuck at some point.\nÂ \nHow Github Codespaces and Github Copilot will help them and make their tasks easier? Watch the video below to find out the answer.\n\n\n\nÂ \nUseful resources:\n\nLearn more about GitHub for EducationÂ and all the benefits for students and educators.\nExplore and build upon all the GitHub Codespaces templates for education.\nIf you missed GitHub Universe, read all the latest announcements.Â \nLearn more about Visual Studio Code and VS Code Extenstions which make it even easier to harness GitHub Codespaces.",

I really liked Python as a teaching language and as a first language for many students, due to its relatively low usage of punctuation and its tendency to read like an English sentence.\nHowever, as it is a text-based language, there are still many frustrating ways to mess up a Python program â spelling things wrong, indenting incorrectly, not using the right function for the job, etc. â and new programmers can have a particularly hard time understanding how to fix incorrect code. Teachers and TAs can help students decipher errors, but weâre not always around when theyâre coding, especially in large classes (my class size ranged from 1000-2000!).\nThatâs why Iâm verâ¦",

Developers who use TDD typically start developing by first writing a test that fails, and then writing the code that makes the test pass. This approach means that product code is more likely to get high test coverage, and the tests typically come first.\nÂ \nMany developers find this pattern useful to help them prioritize good architecture from the start of development, and to stay laser-focused on each part of the functionality they need to implement. This school of thought advocates for testing not being an after-thought of development, but rather a driving force.\nÂ \nFor example, in the following image, you can see thatÂ AddTestÂ is written and failâ¦",

          "description": "Many work apps need the ability to schedule a meeting with others in their organization. Here's how to do it for apps connected to Microsoft 365.\nÂ \nWork apps need work data\nWork apps serve a specific purpose: they help you track projects, follow orders or manage resources. But rarely do they contain all the information that users need to complete their work. Typically, information about people, their calendars, or communication is stored elsewhere, like in Microsoft 365. And that's a shame because completing a task requires users to switch between different apps, which is detrimental to their productivity. Unless of course, you bring work data into your work app.\nÂ \nFind a meeting time and schedule a meeting on Microsoft 365\nA common scenario for work apps is to schedule a meeting with others in the organization. While it sounds trivial, the app must be able to access attendees' calendars, find a suitable meeting time and schedule the meeting. And that's where Microsoft Graph comes in.\nÂ \nRecently I published an article on freeCodeCamp that shows youÂ how to build an app connected to Microsoft 365 that can find a meeting time and schedule a meeting.\nÂ \n\nÂ \nThe app shows you how to make the best use of features available in the Microsoft Graph Toolkit and Microsoft Graph to build a UI that you could integrate with another app.\nÂ \nWant to learn more joing our 30 days of Graph challenge runs from November 1-30, 2022. WatchÂ Â this short YouTube videoÂ to find out why you should participate!Â \nÂ \nRegister for the 30 Days of Microsoft Graph Challenge today.\nÂ \nCheck it out, and I'm looking forward to hearing what you think!",

Toolkit's components help you retrieve relevant data from Microsoft 365 and show it in your app inÂ any way you want. And with toolkit'sÂ authentication providers, setting up auth is a matter of adding a few lines of code. Never again fiddle with setting up a login, handling access tokens, building web requests, and dealing with errors.\nÂ \nLearn Microsoft Graph Toolkit interactively\nTo help you learn what Microsoft Graph Toolkit has to offer and how you'd use it in your app, we recently released a newÂ learning pathÂ on Microsoft Learn. By following a few learn modules you'll learn everything that you need to know to use the toolkit in your app. But that's not all.\nThinking about the different ways in which people learn, we've launched an experiment - anÂ interactive code tourÂ that you can follow to add Microsoft Graph Toolkit to a React app.\n\nÂ \n\nÂ \nBy following the instructions in the tour, you gradually extend an empty React app with Microsoft Graph Toolkit turning it into a true Microsoft 365 app. What's cool about this code tour, is that it puts the code of your app in the center. Rather than reading long-form, you're in the code and get relevant, and in-place tips for building your app.\nÂ \nThe Microsoft Graph Toolkit React code tour is a great way to quickly experience how you'd use the toolkit in a React app. We'd love it if you gave it a try and told us what you think. Shall we consider building tours for other technologies and scenarios?\nÂ \nTry the Microsoft Graph Toolkit React code tour",

To make your Functions app accessible to other applications, add another identity provider or change the security settings to allow unauthenticated access.\nÂ \nIt seems that the link operation will add authentication limitation to only allow static webapp to access the function app. If you navigate to the authentication setting of the function app, you will find the static webapp was added as an identity provider.

          "description": "WordPress is one of the most popular content management systems (CMS) used by website developers. There are two parts to WordPress:\n\nWP Admin: Also called the backend, admin panel, or admin dashboard, this is the admin area where you can manage your website. You can edit posts and pages, install themes and plugins, add or remove users, and change website settings.\nFrontend: This is the section which is accessible to your users. This is where your users can read blog posts, make purchases, or participate in a forum, depending on the kind of website you build using WordPress.\n\nA relatively common problem is that the WP Admin has low performance even when the frontend works fast for your users. Most performance enhancements that you do makes only your frontend faster. This makes it difficult â¦",

More blogs to come on Arc for Azure VMware Solution, but if you want to get some more details check out thisÂ videoÂ fromÂ Jeremiah Megie.\nÂ \nFirst things first. Letâs get Arc for Azure VMware Solution installed into your private cloud.\nYou will need to collect the following information to input into theÂ PowerShell script, which, if you use it, will make the deployment a bit more straightforward.\nÂ \n\nSubscription ID and Resource Group where the Azure VMware Solution private cloud is deployed.\nÂ Name of the Azure VMware Solution private cloud.\nÂ /28 network segment for the ARC appliance.\n\n\nThe/28 network segment will be an NSX-T segment in the private cloud. Under the covers, the deployment script creates NSX-T segment for use by the ARC appliances. The value must be entered into the script as the gateway to the segment, followed by /28. For example, if 192.168.99.1/28 is entered, there will be a /28 NSX-T segment created with the gateway 192.168.99.1.\nÂ \nThe other information you can get from the Overview blade of your private cloud.\nÂ \n\nÂ \nRequirements\n\nYour private cloud must have Internet access.\nAlso, because of the appliance size, ideally you would want to run this script as close to the private cloud, or from a machine inside the AVS Private Cloud.\n\nThe script can be found here;\nhttps://virtualworkloads.com/2023/02/deploy-arc-for-azure-vmware-solution-simply-using-powershell/#script",

In new experience, there is\nRules managementÂ â UsesÂ Data Collection RulesÂ to configure or customize various aspects of data collection. For example, you can change the frequency of file collection. DCRs let you configure data collection for specific machines connected to a workspace as compared to the \"all or nothing\" approach of legacy agents.\n\nHow to get started?\nYou can onboard to Change Tracking & Inventory with AMA either via Azure Portal or by using Azury Policy (to onboard at scale). To onboard single VM via portal, click on specific VM name from Virtual Machines -> Change Tracking -> Enable using AMA agent (Preview). To know more about the various methods to enable Change Tracking, click here\nOnboarding from Single VM view\n\nÂ \nOnboarding via DINE Policies (at scale onboarding)\n\nIn the public preview, Change Tracking with AMA supports Window Files, Windows Registry and Software data types. We are working towards facilitating the support of Windows services & Linux Daemons by GA. The data configuration can now be regulated at DCR level now. ClickÂ here toÂ know more about Data Collection Rules.\nÂ \nYou can check out ourÂ complete documentationÂ to get more details.

With the at-scale power of Azure Policy and the ability to block delete calls, denyAction allows you to prevent accidental deletions of your critical resources.Â \nÂ \nSample denyAction definition that blocks delete calls on any virtual machines:Â \n\nÂ \nYou are able to create these definitions in Portal or API. All denyAction definitions will have a compliance state of 'Not Started' during preview, and will introduce a new compliance state of 'Protected' for GA.

With preview feedback addressed and services now fully scaled out to meet the complex needs of these users and more, we are today excited to announce the revamped custom logs features are now generally available!\n \nToday, we are announcing the following:\n\nGA of the Log Ingestion API. This secure, scalable, and flexible API is the path going forward for all custom data ingestion needs.\nGA of the Ingestion-time Transformations feature. This feature allows users to customize built-in data streams to parse, enrich, filter, or otherwise tailor incoming data to their specific use-cases.\nA pricing for data sent to the system and subsequently dropped in a transformation. A nominal fee per GB dropped will be charged for any data dropped beyond 50% of incoming data, calculated daily. The fee is waived for Azure Sentinel-enabled workspaces. While we're announcing billing today, we will not start charging yet as of this announcement, and will provide at least a 3-month notice before doing so. The Azure Monitor pricing page will be imminently updated with these details.\n\n \nScreenshot of ingestion-time transformation UI\n \n \n \nFor those of you who participated in our preview - thank you for your feedback, and to those new to the features - we're excited for you to start using them!

It is a new capability in Azure Monitor toâ¯help Java developers troubleshoot performance issues and uncover performance bottlenecks.Â \nâ¯Â \nUnder the hood, it uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to profile your application using a customized configuration.â¯ For additional context, JFR is a tool that collects profiling data of running Java applications, and it is integrated into theâ¯Java Virtual Machine (JVM). JFR comes with little to barely noticeable overhead cost which makes it great to run on heavily loaded production deployments.Â \nâ¯Â \nUsing the customized configuration, you can generate profiles in two ways:Â \nâ¯Â \n\nAutomated Profiling - Configure CPU and memory thresholds to automatically trigger a profile recording.Â \nOn-demand Profiling - Use âProfile Nowâ to run near real-time profile recording.Â \n\nÂ To try out the Java Profiler:\nÂ \n\nEnable Azure Monitor Application Insights using v3.4.1 jar file or later.Â \nEnable the profiler using the java profiler installation guidance and set yourâ¯CPU/Memory triggers for automatic profiling.Â \nClick the \"Profiler\" button on the Application Insights Performance Blade and click \"Profile Now\" for an on-demand profile.Â \nDownload the profiling session when it becomes available (it may take about 5 minutes to show up in Portal).Â \nView and analyze the profile withâ¯Java Mission Control (JMC)â¯or another tool (java profiles are not currently viewable in Portal).Â \n\nâ¯Â \n\nâ\nâ¯Â \nJava Profiling is in preview today and can be enabled acrossâ¯all your JVMs. Even better, it is included in Application Insights for no additional cost.â¯Try it out and let us know what you think!",
