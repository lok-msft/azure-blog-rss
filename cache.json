I do learn Go to better understand Kubernetes, for example.\r\nOf course, we deal with some primitives and basic structures, first of all.\r\nThen we implement some well-known algorithms like bubble sort, Fibonacci number or sqrt function to get used to the language style and expectations.\r\nAnd now what?\r\nWe have some real use-cases where this or that functionality…",

          "description": "Hot on the heels of Spring Boot 3.0.2, I am excited to announce the 0.3 release of Spring Modulith.\r\nThe release is packed with improvements.\r\nWe have tweaked a couple of things that might require your attention and a couple of adapting changes to your code.\r\nThe most notable changes are:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-114 – We renamed the ….modulith.model package to ….modulith.core. This primarily affects ApplicationModules. Please adapt your imports accordingly.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-120 – The documentation support now generates diagram files using the *.puml file extension, as suggested by PlantUML. Please adapt your imports accordingly.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-103 – ApplicationModuleInitializer implementations will be triggered upon application startup, in the order following the application module dependency structure (more core ones are invoked first). Also, ApplicationModules exposes a ….getComparator() to order Spring beans that way. Note, that this requires the JGraphT library to be on the classpath (automatically pulled in via the spring-modulith-runtime artifact). See the reference documentation for details.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-116 – PublishedEvents now sees events published from asynchronous event listeners, too.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-100 – If you’re using AssertJ in your tests, you can now use AssertablePublishedEvents for a more streamlined integration  (for example, assertThat(events).contains(MyEvent.class).matching(…)).\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-117 – As we incentivize event-based, asynchronous application module integration, the test starter now also pulls in Awaitility.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-111 – We now publish aggregated Javdoc.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFind a complete change log in the GitHub release page. We are looking forward to your feedback in the GitHub discussions.",

It’s going to be awesome! \n\r\n\r\nLook, it’s Tuesday. Tuesdays are no fun. We’re three solid days away from fun winter ski slopes from Friday. But that’s OK because every day is a chance to learn. And this week’s no exception: we’ve got a ton to look at it, so let’s dive right into it! \n\r\n\r\n  \nA Bootiful Podcast: Mario Fusco, the Drools rules engine project lead and fellow Java Champion\n\r\n  \nComplex Event Processing with Esper and Spring Boot\n\r\n  \nSpring Boot Multi-tenant Architecture Overview\n\r\n  \nSpring Data 2022.0.1 and 2021.2.7 available\n\r\n  \nSpring Framework 5.3.25 available now\n\r\n  \nSpring Framework 6.0.4 available now\n\r\n  \nSpring MVC – Mapping the Root URL to a Page\n\r\n  \nSpring Shell 2.1.5 and 3.0.0-RC1 are now available\n\r\n  \nEasy JVM Observability with the JCMD CLI\n\r\n  \nThis is super cool: GraalVM Native Image meets RISC-V Even cooler? The implementation might pave the way for GraalVM compilation to WebAssembly… Imagine, friends. One day, through the magic of open source, we could compile a Spring Boot application to WebAssembly. What a time to be alive!\n\r\n  \nImplementing Retry In Kafka Consumer\n\r\n  \nRecords Are Here! Can We Remove Lombok Already?\n\r\n  \nRelease v6.0.0-M0 · jobrunr/jobrunr. First milestone. This release also supports Spring Authorization Server\n\r\n  \nFlyway Out of Order Migrations",

I love PostgreSQL. But then he goes even further, turning the mechanism into support in Spring Integration. He explains everything in this epic post, Using Postgres as a Message Queue\n\r\n  \nCreate a new Git branch with no history - not strictly speaking Spring-related, but I thought it was interesting.

I’m in a warm cozy office. Good music is playing. People are asleep in my home. I can hear the raindrops and wind outside the window. I’m at peace as I code. And code I have. I’ve been updating my blog, and a half dozen little side projects, to the new Spring Boot 3. This has given me a chance to do a little, shall we say, Spring cleaning, and also update my Github Actions to the latest and greatest. I’m pleasantly surprised by how many builds I’ve switched over to 3.0 and then used the AOT engine to build a GraalVM native image and it just worked! \n\r\nHow were or are your holidays going?

See my friends on the Spring team in person since the pandemic descended. And, I’m overjoyed to relate, I’ve just had the privilege of a nice meeting with several of them last night. And I’m going to see more of them today! Seriously. I feel like I won the lottery. I’ve missed my friends. Hug your friends and family, friends. You never know when the next pandemic (or life in general) will put distance between you and them. So, in order to close that distance, I’m going to go back to meetings with them, and I’ll leave you with yet another week’s curated list of content.

Spring Cloud Stream version 3.0.0 moved the Schema Registry components into a top-level spring-cloud project, and Spring Cloud Stream included those in its BOM for the end user applications to consume them. However, this didn’t scale well, and with the 3.2 version, we decided to stop having them as part of the Spring Cloud Stream BOM. \n\r\nThe schema registry use ca…",

While the cache is useful for improving performance, it can also become cluttered over time and slow down the app. Deleting the cache can help improve Microsoft Teams performance by reducing the amount of temporary data stored which can also free up storage space. \n \nThe Microsoft Teams cache can be deleted manually by deleting all the files and folders in the %appdata%\\Microsoft\\Teams directory for each user profile.

          "description": "A picture showing .NET\nWhat is .NET MAUI?\n.NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) is a cross-platform framework for creating native mobile and desktop apps with C# and XAML. Using .NET MAUI, you can develop apps that can run on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows from a single shared code-base.\nUsing .NET MAUI, you can create multi-platform apps using a single project, but you can add platform-specific source code and resources if necessary. One of the key aims of .NET MAUI is to enable you to implement as much of your app logic and UI layout as possible in a single code-base.\n \nIn this blog, we will cover how to Build a Water Consumption Mobile App using .NET MAUI that consumes historical data from a Web API. This solution is part of a project build for .NET Conf Student Zone 2022\n \nWhat will we be doing?\nBefore you can get started, we need a few things set up first:\n\nBuild a Mininal API from scratch to consume in your app\nBuild your first .NET MAUI App\nAdd a Consumption.cs class with the following propertiesA picture showing the Consumption.cs class\nAdd a APIManager.cs class to house the HTTP methods for your APIA picture showing the APIManager.cs class\n\nAfter the above are added, you can start to:\n\nConsume A Web API – this will show how you to consume the historical data stored in the Web API and display on your mobile app.\nSend data to your Web API using the HTTP Post Method (shown in the link above too).\n\n \nWe have a dedicated Microsoft learn module that will show you how to Consume and Send Data to your Web API. All of the code for this part of the project and other parts are available on the .NET Student Zone Githup Repositry\n \nTo see and understand the how to implement this in Visual Studio you can watch my session below.\n\nFinally, if you are curious about where the API data comes from, you can explore the other sessions of the .Net Student Conf and understand how all the different pieces and different technologies of .NET ecosystem are combined together into a single e-2-e project.",

In short terms, GitHub is known as the developer's best friend. \nAs software and technologies continue to evolve, also Github platform and services are constantly evolving. In this blog post, I wish to show you how the latest Git tools, GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Copilot, can transform and support the world of education.\n \nIn the following video, you'll be listening about two stories, whose scenarios will be familiar to anyone who is studying or teaching at University, or simply anyone who ever learned a new programming language/framework or prepared a hands-on workshop to deliver. \nThe first story's character is Ali, a Data Science teacher at the University of Nowhere. She is preparing for her spring semester course and in particular, she’s preparing a guided tutorial, with a full list of all the instructions her students will need to set up the environment for her Python lab.\nThe second story is about Mark. Mark is a student at University of Nowhere. He attended the Python data science lab by prof Ali and now he needs to complete the assignment at home. However, he gets stuck at some point.\n \nHow Github Codespaces and Github Copilot will help them and make their tasks easier? Watch the video below to find out the answer.\n\n\n\n \nUseful resources:\n\nLearn more about GitHub for Education and all the benefits for students and educators.\nExplore and build upon all the GitHub Codespaces templates for education.\nIf you missed GitHub Universe, read all the latest announcements. \nLearn more about Visual Studio Code and VS Code Extenstions which make it even easier to harness GitHub Codespaces.",

          "description": "Before joining Microsoft, I spent three semesters teaching Python in UC Berkeley’s CS61A, the first class in their CS sequence. I really liked Python as a teaching language and as a first language for many students, due to its relatively low usage of punctuation and its tendency to read like an English sentence.\nHowever, as it is a text-based language, there are still many frustrating ways to mess up a Python program – spelling things wrong, indenting incorrectly, not using the right function for the job, etc. – and new programmers can have a particularly hard time understanding how to fix incorrect code. Teachers and TAs can help students decipher errors, but we’re not always around when they’re coding, especially in large classes (my class size ranged from 1000-2000!).\nThat’s why I’m ver…",

Developers who use TDD typically start developing by first writing a test that fails, and then writing the code that makes the test pass. This approach means that product code is more likely to get high test coverage, and the tests typically come first.\n \nMany developers find this pattern useful to help them prioritize good architecture from the start of development, and to stay laser-focused on each part of the functionality they need to implement. This school of thought advocates for testing not being an after-thought of development, but rather a driving force.\n \nFor example, in the following image, you can see that AddTest is written and fail…",

This approach allows you to have full flexibility over your database calls but building out such a backend can be tedious and complex, especially when considering the edge cases of a data-access backend such as authorization and relationships. With Static Web Apps’ database connections feature, and its underlying open-source project Data API Builder, you now have more options to build out database-backed web applications. In this blog article, we cover the considerations of choosing between these various options.\n \nA quick introduction to the Static Web Apps database connections feature\n \nAs announced last week, Static Web Apps database connections is a new feature to connect and use databases directly …",

When load testing an application, this generally is the first step in the user journey.  Supplying client credentials through a UI is not possible when load testing an application, so is evaluating how to implement specific authentication flows available on Azure, as they can be tedious and time consuming as well.\nWithin this series, we will cover the authentication flows and scenarios that are possible with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as the identity provider.\nAt the end of the blog, you will be able to\n\nUse Azure AD to Authenticate a web application hosted on Azure App Service using the client credential grant flow.\nParametrize…",

Nowadays, by leveraging cloud features such as scalability, elasticity, and convenience, businesses can deploy, grow, or test an environment in every corner of the world without worrying about building the required infrastructure.\n \nUnlike the traditional model, which was based on notifying the service provider to set up the resources for customers in advance, in an on-demand model, cloud providers implement application programming interfaces (API) that can be used by customers to deploy resources on demand. This allows the customer to access an unlimited amount of resources on-demand and only pay for the resources they use without worrying about th…",

Create a new Web app for Windows using any available Runtime stack for Windows.\n\n \n2. After the creation complete, go to Kudu site from Azure Portal:\n\n \n3. Create a new directory and download the PHP runtime(Non Thread Safe Version) from PHP For Windows: Binaries and sources Releases and extract it, in this demo, we use php 8.2.1, the output is as below:\n \n \nmkdir php\ncurl https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.2.1-nts-Win32-vs16-x64.zip -o php\\php.zip\ncd php\nunzip php.zip\n \n \n\n\n \n4. Go to Path mappings in configuration. Add a new handler mapping. The extension is \"*.php\", the Script processor is \"C:\\home\\php\\php-cgi.exe\". Then save it. All the configuration is done.\n\n \n5. To verify it, we can create an \"index.php\" file under C:\\home\\site\\wwwroot with below content. The result would look like as below:\n \n<?\nphpinfo();\n \n \n\n \nI hope you enjoy it.",

Please refer to the steps below:\n \n\nFirst call the POST Slot-Swap API & it will trigger the swap operation as shown below:\n\nhttps://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{SubscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{name}/slots/{slot}/slotsswap?api-version=2022-03-01\n \n \n\n \n2. The above API will have location parameter in Response Headers with Operation Results API call which can be used to continuously poll in a loop until the Response is 200 (Swap completed) or (failure status code in case of swap failure)\n \nGET: https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{SubscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{name}/slots/{slot}/operationresults/915677b6-ea92-44c9-865b-95cfc693d5bb?api-version=2018-11-01\n \nPolling: Swap in accepted/in-progress state:\n \n\n \nPolling: Swap completed:\n \n\n \nThanks to @DeependraChaudhary for sharing the approach.\nIf you have any questions or feedback, please add a comment below.",

Some of the metrics exposed to users are as shown below:\n\n \n\n \nCurrently, the queue settings and message counts are only updated if the page is voluntarily refreshed by the user. A lot of users are interested in the metrics getting updated automatically when they are in an active queue without voluntarily reloading the page or refreshing the page. This also impacts customers flow introducing a context switch.\n \nEnabling auto-refresh of message counters\n \nThe feature is set to “off” by default. Users are free to turn the Auto-refresh toggle to “on” and select the time interval at which they would like to see the counters refreshed automatically.

Even better, there is no cost to deploy Arc for Azure VMware Solution. More blogs to come on Arc for Azure VMware Solution, but if you want to get some more details check out this video from Jeremiah Megie.\n \nFirst things first. Let’s get Arc for Azure VMware Solution installed into your private cloud.\nYou will need to collect the following information to input into the PowerShell script, which, if you use it, will make the deployment a bit more straightforward.\n \n\nSubscription ID and Resource Group where the Azure VMware Solution private cloud is deployed.\n Name of the Azure VMware Solution private cloud.\n /28 network segment for the ARC appliance.\n\n\nThe/28 network segment will be an NSX-T segment in the private cloud. Under the covers, the deployment script creates NSX-T segment for use by the ARC appliances. The value must be entered into the script as the gateway to the segment, followed by /28. For example, if 192.168.99.1/28 is entered, there will be a /28 NSX-T segment created with the gateway 192.168.99.1.\n \nThe other information you can get from the Overview blade of your private cloud.\n \n\n \nRequirements\n\nYour private cloud must have Internet access.\nAlso, because of the appliance size, ideally you would want to run this script as close to the private cloud, or from a machine inside the AVS Private Cloud.\n\nThe script can be found here;\nhttps://virtualworkloads.com/2023/02/deploy-arc-for-azure-vmware-solution-simply-using-powershell/#script",

This preview supports the new AMA agent and enhances the following:\n\nSecurity/Reliability and Scale - The Azure Monitor Agent enhances security, reliability, and facilitates multi-homing experience to store data.\nSimplified onboarding- You can onboard to Virtual Machines directly to Change Tracking (add link) without needing to configure an Automation account. In new experience, there is\nRules management – Uses Data Collection Rules to configure or customize various aspects of data collection. For example, you can change the frequency of file collection. DCRs let you configure data collection for specific machines connected to a workspace as compared to the \"all or nothing\" approach of legacy agents.\n\nHow to get started?\nYou can onboard to Change Tracking & Inventory with AMA either via Azure Portal or by using Azury Policy (to onboard at scale). To onboard single VM via portal, click on specific VM name from Virtual Machines -> Change Tracking -> Enable using AMA agent (Preview). To know more about the various methods to enable Change Tracking, click here\nOnboarding from Single VM view\n\n \nOnboarding via DINE Policies (at scale onboarding)\n\nIn the public preview, Change Tracking with AMA supports Window Files, Windows Registry and Software data types. We are working towards facilitating the support of Windows services & Linux Daemons by GA. The data configuration can now be regulated at DCR level now. Click here to know more about Data Collection Rules.\n \nYou can check out our complete documentation to get more details.
