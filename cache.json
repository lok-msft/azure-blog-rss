Microservice-based systems have become ubiquitous in the last couple of years.

For the complete list of changes, please check the release notes.\nExecution context Meta-data improvement\n\r\nIn addition to what Spring Batch already persists in the execution context with regard to runtime information (like the step type, the restart flag, etc), this release adds an important detail in the execution context which is the Spring Batch version that was used to serialize the context.\n\r\nWhile this seems a detail, it has a huge added value when debugging upgrade issues with regard to execution context serialization and deserialization.\nGemFire support removal\n\r\nBased on the decision to discontinue the support of Spring Data for Apache Geode, the support for Apache Geode in Spring Batch was removed.\n\r\nThe code was moved to the spring-batch-extensions repository as a community-driven effort.\nWhat’s next?\n\r\nWe are planning to roll out a second release candidate early November and release 5.0.0 GA by the end of November, in time for Spring Boot 3.0.0. We would appreciate your help to try this release candidate out and share your feedback with us on Github, Twitter and StackOverflow.

That was a personal career highlight for me - it’s not often you get to win and have fun in life. And, as if that wasn’t awesome enough, this week I am in Las Vegas, NV, for JavaOne!

GraphQL is a good use case for Observability in general, as the GraphQL engine can distribute the data fetching operations over caches, databases, REST APIs and more. It’s important not only to keep track of performance metrics for your GraphQL API, but also to be able to explore traces and investigate production issues.\n\r\nWe didn’t have time to tackle features like Pagination/Relay or AOT/Native support, but we’re listening to the community.

I was just at Devoxx in Belgium, where hundreds of experts from across the Java ecosystem converged for the first time since 2019 to deliver their biggest and best. \n\r\nI could do a proper trip report, but I really just came here to point you to two talks from two of my amazing teammates, Stéphane Nicoll (@snicoll) and Brian Clozel (@bclozel), who have been very hard at work on both Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, both of which will land by the end of November, 2022. These are brand new generations of the framework, implying huge new paradigms and new opportunities for developers. \n\r\nThis first is a broader, whirlwind tour of the new features in Spring Framework 6 (which bubble up into Spring Boot 3).\n\r\n\r\nThis second one introduces the new ahead-of-time (AOT) support in Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, which makes it trivial to build GraalVM native images.\n\r\n\n\r\nNB: please ignore the metadata for the YouTube videos. Both talks feature both speakers, and there is no mention whatsoever of React and JavaScript and the like. I think that was a metadata issue with the publication of the videos on YouTube, which will hopefully be resolved. \n\r\nEnjoy!",

          "description": "On behalf of the team and all contributors, I am pleased to announce that Spring Batch 5.0.0-M8 is now available from our milestone repository.\n\r\nIn this milestone, we introduced two main changes:\n\r\n\r\n  \nNew default execution context serialization format\n\r\n  \nSystemCommandTasklet enhancements\n\r\n\r\nThis blog post walks through these two major changes in details. For the complete list of changes,\nplease check the release notes.\nNew default execution context serialization format\n\r\nIn this milestone release, the DefaultExecutionContextSerializer was updated to serialize/deserialize the context to/from Base64.\n\r\nMoreover, the default ExecutionContextSerializer configured by @EnableBatchProcessing or DefaultBatchConfiguration was changed from JacksonExecutionContextStringSerializer to DefaultExecutionContextSerializer. The dependency to Jackson was made optional. In order to use the JacksonExecutionContextStringSerializer, jackson-core should be added to the classpath.\nSystemCommandTasklet enhancements\n\r\nThe SystemCommandTasklet has been revisited in this release and was changed as follows:\n\r\n\r\n  \n\r\n  \nA new strategy interface named CommandRunner was introduced in order to decouple the command execution from the tasklet execution. The default implementation is the JvmCommandRunner which uses the java.lang.Runtime#exec API to run system commands. This interface can be implemented to use any other API to run system commands.\n\r\n  \n\r\n  \nThe method that runs the command now accepts an array of Strings representing the command and its arguments. There is no need to tokenize the command or do any pre-processing anymore. This change makes the API more intuitive, and less prone to errors.\n\r\n\nFeedback\n\r\nI would like to thank all contributors who had a role in this release! As we continue\nour work on Spring Batch 5, we look forward to your feedback on Github, Twitter and StackOverflow.\n\r\n\r\nSpring Batch Home|Source on Github|Reference documentation",

          "description": "I’m pleased to announce the first milestone release of Spring for GraphQL 1.1.0 is now available from our Milestone repository. This version will be shipped with Spring Boot 3.0.0-M5 due for release later this week.\n\r\nSpring Boot 3.0 is around the corner and the community is expecting a compatible Spring for GraphQL version to go with it. Currently, the best way to prepare for the Spring Boot 3.0 upgrade is to upgrade to Spring Boot 2.7 and Java 17, but Spring Boot 3.0 has new baseline requirements, namely Java 17, Jakarta APIs and Spring Framework 6.0.\n\r\nGiven that Spring for GraphQL 1.0.0 was released towards the end of May this year, we didn’t feel we would have enough time nor feedback to go with a major release of the project for Boot 3.0. This is why the goal of the 1.1 release is simply to adapt to the new baseline requirements and provide a smooth upgrade to Spring Boot 3.0 for existing projects.\n\r\nThis first milestone brings those foundational changes: the Java 17, Jakarta APIs, and a Spring Framework 6.0 baseline. We’re also taking the opportunity to upgrade to GraphQL Java 19.x – a painless upgrade on our side, thanks to the GraphQL Java team! We’ve also replaced our internally developed context propagation mechanism with the new Micrometer Context Propagation library, that’s intended for use broadly across Spring projects. It allows Spring applications to propagate context across various such mechanisms, e.g. ThreadLocal, Reactor Context, GraphQLContext, and others.\n\r\nIn the next milestones, we will consider how we can adapt our current arrangement with important themes in Spring Boot 3.0: GraalVM native image and Micrometer Observability support. Given the short timeline, we might schedule some changes for a future version – again, a smooth upgrade is our top priority here.\nHow can you help?\n\r\nIf you have general questions, please ask on stackoverflow.com using the spring-graphql tag.\n\r\nProject Page | GitHub | Issues | Documentation | Stack Overflow",

          "description": "It has been almost 4 years since the last set of Spring Web Flow releases. Nevertheless, the project continues to serve a specific need particularly well, arguably better than alternatives, and remains in active use. While there hasn’t been a strong driver for new releases, the upcoming Spring Framework 6 brings a Java 17 baseline and makes the shift to Jakarta EE, which creates the need for such a release in order to enable applications to migrate to this new baseline.\n\r\nToday I’m pleased to announce the availability of Spring Web Flow 3.0 M1 in the Spring milestone repository. This release focuses mainly on compatibility with Spring Framework 6 and Jakarta EE. The Travel booking-mvc sample on spring-projects/spring-webflow-samples has been updated and the commit history provides example changes. One significant change is the need to remove Tiles which has not migrated to Jakarta EE. In the sample, Thymeleaf Layouts is used instead.\n\r\nNote that Spring Faces is not included in the release due to its deep integration with JSF and the additional time and effort required to migrate. Please, reach out if you have experience with Web Flow and JSF and are interested to help out with the migration of Spring Faces to Spring Framework 6 and Jakarta EE.\n\r\nIf you have a Web Flow application and you plan to migrate to Spring Framework 6, please give this milestone a try and provide feedback through the project issue tracker. Special thanks to Ian Young and Scott Cantor for their substantial contributions to this release!",

It has been just over two years since we initially announced this new project, and we have come a long way since its initial development.

It’s endless. It has no end. Like the bugs in code. Endless.

          "description": "Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! How are you? This week I’m writing you from sunny Seattle, Washington, where we’re having our next installment of the SpringOne Tour series. It’s been a ton of fun seeing all these fun and friendly faces again and getting to see people, many of whom I haven’t seen since before the pandemic! I’ve also had a lot of fun seeing some friends from some of the big cloud companies here, Microsoft and AWS. It’s always interesting to learn how people are using the latest and greatest from Spring to build amazing systems and software targeting these cloud platforms.\n\r\nWe’ve got a lot to cover this week so let’s dive right into it!\n\r\n\r\n  \nIn last week’s podcast, I talked to Kubernetes contributor and fellow Tanzu Developer Advocate Leigh Capili\n\r\n  \nDistributed Tracing With OpenTelemetry, Spring Cloud Sleuth, Kafka, and Jaeger\n\r\n  \nIngress vs. Load Balancer in Kubernetes\n\r\n  \nInstantiating Multiple Beans of the Same Class with Spring Annotations\n\r\n  \nCurious about when and why to use Java 14 Records vs. Lombok? Check out this article\n\r\n  \nI put together this little example , thanks to Reactor lead Simon Baslé, showing how to handle pagination with the expand operator in Project Reactor: Pagination in a Reactive Application. It looks at how to eleganrly expand the contents of a reactive stream as new data (in a data pagination scenario) becomes available.\n\r\n  \nSpring Shell 2.1.0-RC1 is now available\n\r\n  \nPushing a Docker Image to a Self-Hosted Registry\n\r\n  \nSpring for Apache Kafka 2.9 Release Candidate Available\n\r\n  \nThis Apache Maven Survival Guide is quite interesting, to me at least!",

Shasta, Crater Lake, Lassen National Park, etc. It was a ton of fun, and a lot of driving! Anyway, it all kinda blurs together and felt like just one weekend, and today feels like Monday. I only just realized it was Tuesday! And you know what that means?

Check that page out and find links to all eight videos, each of which introduces one interesting dimension of the powerful and novel new Spring for GraphQL project.\n\r\n  \nIn last week’s installment of A Bootiful Podcast, I talk to Spring Developer Advocate Dan Vega\n\r\n  \nProcessing the Response Body in Spring Cloud Gateway\n\r\n  \nSpring Cloud 2020.0.6 is available\n\r\n  \nUUID as Entity ID in MongoDB\n\r\n  \nI liked this post over on Dzone: Are All Kubernetes Ingresses the Same?\n\r\n  \nWant to learn more about how to build GraalVM native images for Spring Boot 2.x-generation applications?

Now, I’m back in beautiful San Francisco. Today the weather will climb to a monumental 84 F! That’s very unusual, for any time of the year, here in San Francisco. Most places here in San Francisco don’t have air conditioning. Some have heating. I bought a brand new condo in 2014 and it didn’t have air conditioning. You just open the window. I am privileged enough that I have air conditioning today, of course. I mention all this to say that it’s hot here! I worry for the elderly! When it gets this hot, the YMCA and other organizations typically invite elderly people to come in and get some cool air and water. It’s dangerous. Some days it gets even hotter. Very rare, but it does happen. I hope you’re all doing well. Take care of yourselves and each other, my friends. \n\r\nAnd, speaking of being hot, let’s look at this week’s roundup of the latest-and-greatest that’s hot off the press! \n\r\n\r\n  \nBootiful Podcast: Spring Framework contributor Sébastien Deleuze on GraalVM, AOT, project Leyden, and WebAssembly\n\r\n  \nCVE report published for Spring Cloud Function\n\r\n  \nDebugging Collections, Streams and Watch Renderers\n\r\n  \nDifference Between Flux.create and Flux.generate\n\r\n  \nHandle Spring Security Exceptions With @ExceptionHandler\n\r\n  \nMongoDB Composite Key With Spring Data\n\r\n  \nSpring Authorization Server 0.3.1 available now\n\r\n  \nMonitoring Spring Boot applications using Spring Boot Admin\n\r\n  \nSpring Data 2021.2.1 and 2021.1.5 released\n\r\n  \nSpring Data JPA – Run an App Without a Database\n\r\n  \nSpring Data MongoDB SpEL Expression Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2022-22980)\n\r\n  \nSpring Framework 5.3.21 available now\n\r\n  \nSpring Security 5.7.2 and 5.6.6 available now\n\r\n  \nSpring Tools 4.15.0 released\n\r\n  \nSpring Tools 4.15.1 released\n\r\n  \nWhat are the Spring Boot Default Memory Settings?\n\r\n  \nA Guide to Docker Private Registry\n\r\n  \nIs There a Destructor in Java?",

I wrote this blog for testing based on Azure docs.\n \nSee move across subscriptions \n\n \nTesting Steps\n1. Prerequisites\n2. Upload and bind certificates to App Service\n3. Do the migration\n4. Validate the result\n \n1. Prerequisites\n- App Service- App service domain: in my case, tlsmigrationtest.com- Add a custom domain to App Service: SSL isn't bound yet\n\n \n2. Upload and bind certificates\nUpload certificate (.pfx) and bind certificate to the app service domain.\nA. App service > TLS/SSL settings > Private Key Certificates (.pfx) > Upload Certificate\n\n \nB. Upload the certificate\n\nC. Bind certificates\nApp Service > Custom domains > Add bindings\n\n \nAfter finishing the above steps, you can see the SSL binding to the App Service domain.\n\n \n3. Migration across subscriptions with uploaded certificates\nA. For migration, go to your resource group.\n \nB. Before moving resources you must click \"show hidden types\"\nWhen you check \"show hidden types\", you can see uploaded certificates.\n\n \nC. Check all App service resources and click move to another subscription\nYou must move all App Service resources together such as App Service, App service domain, and certificates.\nCheck limitation Move Azure App Service resources across resource groups or subscriptions - Azure Resource Manager | Microsoft Learn\n\n \nD. Validate the result\nBefore you migrate app service resources, you can see the validation status.\nIf you can see succeeded status like below, you will be able to migrate successfully.\n\n \n4.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), the managed Kubernetes offering from Azure, allows customers to offload the operational overhead to Azure, thus letting the user focus primarily on their workloads and business logic. However, as users migrate large scale workloads to containers, they often create a large number of AKS clusters for various reasons – clusters in different environments (QA/test, staging, prod), clusters in different regions for high availability or localization/proximity, or using clusters to achieve strong isolation between workloads.

Armchair Architects, Uli Homann and Eric Charran, joined David Blank-Edelman for a lively discussion of Chaos Engineering from an architect’s point-of-view on the Azure Enablement Show. Read below for highlights and watch the video.\n \n \nHow do architects define and think about Chaos Engineering? \nChaos engineering is that part of application development in which you try to excise uncertainty about specific failure conditions that might happen with the system or its components. Many architects just guess what's going to happen if there's a failure condition, and in many instances, they don't even like to think about it. When you’re designing an elegant solution the last thing you want to think about…",

          "description": "Background  \nThe Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a management platform that you can use to manage your IT and development infrastructure with configuration as code. The Azure Desired State Configuration (DSC) extension helps bootstrap a VM to the Azure Automation State Configuration (DSC) service. The DSC extension can be installed on Azure VMs as a Virtual Machine Extension.  The DSCForLinux extension installs the OMI and DSC agent on Azure virtual machines.  \n  \nOver the past year, our team has been developing Automatic Extension Upgrade which now supports the DSC extension. When Automatic Extension Upgrade for the DSC extension is enabled on a VM, the extension is upgraded automatically whenever Microsoft releases a new version for the extension. You can do this by simply setting the flag to true via API, CLI or PowerShell as documented here.  \n   \nSecurity Recommendations  \nWe strongly recommend enabling automatic updates for the DSC extension as soon as possible. This update ensures that customers get important security or performance updates to the extension as soon as possible without manual overhead.  \n   \nAs always, we welcome feedback from customers and partners which supports our efforts to continuously harden our products and services. We want to thank the Wiz team for their collaboration and commitment to helping make Azure customers more secure.",

This past year, we have been working to support customers more holistically, shipping the public preview of  “Apply and Monitor” and “Apply and Autocorrect” assignment types, and are working hard on the upcoming GA of these capabilities.\n \nWe have been listening to our customers as well as the community and are excited to announce a name that highlights the current and future capabilities of our service. Guest configuration will become machine configuration. In addition to the name change, we are moving under the Automanage brand umbrella to reinforce the message that the goal of machine configuration is to reduce op-ex and customer burden in managing their Windows and Linux machines both in Azure and on-premises. It is important to note that the current experience within policy will not change. Customers will still be able to apply machine configurations at scale through policy assignments as they have thus far. \n \nThis rebranding will go live soon in the Azure portal as well as our documentation.

          "description": "Java Profiler for Azure Monitor Application Insights is now in Public Preview. It is a new capability in Azure Monitor to help Java developers troubleshoot performance issues and uncover performance bottlenecks. \n  \nUnder the hood, it uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to profile your application using a customized configuration.  For additional context, JFR is a tool that collects profiling data of running Java applications, and it is integrated into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). JFR comes with little to barely noticeable overhead cost which makes it great to run on heavily loaded production deployments. \n  \nUsing the customized configuration, you can generate profiles in two ways: \n  \n\nAutomated Profiling - Configure CPU and memory thresholds to automatically trigger a profile recording. \nOn-demand Profiling - Use “Profile Now” to run near real-time profile recording. \n\n To try out the Java Profiler:\n \n\nEnable Azure Monitor Application Insights using v3.4.1 jar file or later. \nEnable the profiler using the java profiler installation guidance and set your CPU/Memory triggers for automatic profiling. \nClick the \"Profiler\" button on the Application Insights Performance Blade and click \"Profile Now\" for an on-demand profile. \nDownload the profiling session when it becomes available (it may take about 5 minutes to show up in Portal). \nView and analyze the profile with Java Mission Control (JMC) or another tool (java profiles are not currently viewable in Portal). \n\n  \n\n \n  \nJava Profiling is in preview today and can be enabled across all your JVMs. Even better, it is included in Application Insights for no additional cost. Try it out and let us know what you think!",
