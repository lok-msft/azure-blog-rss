But what about all those questions that can’t be answered by the data?

This post will guide you through the fundamental structure of a cloud-native app, situations where you should build a cloud-native app, and more. Let’s get started!\nWhat are Cloud-Native Apps?\nCloud-native apps represent a modern approach to app development, designed with cloud technologies in mind. Unlike apps designed to run on premises, cloud-native apps can fully leverage the many services Azure offers. Many cloud architects opt for Open-Source Software (OSS) like Kubernetes and Docker when designing cloud-native apps, but turn to proprietary offerings like Cosmos DB when the benefit is overwhelming. This makes the end-to-end process of building an application easier, focusing on architectural modularity, rather than m…",

This distributed microservices architecture allows multiple teams within large organizations to operate independently of each other and release new versions of their microservices at their own cadence. However, this requires an additional level of supervision to address observability, traffic management, and security use cases for service-to-service communication across these distributed workloads.

Cutting through the tech jargon, observability is a measure of how well we understand the system from the outside looking in.\n \nYou might wonder, isn’t that monitoring? Well, not quite. Monitoring tells you when something is wrong, like if your CPU is overloaded or if there’s a glitch slowing things down (that’s the “What”). Observability, on the other hand, is like being a detective. It helps you understand the story behind the problem (the “Why”).\n \nLet’s say an app is responding slowly. We might have all these cool charts and graphs showing us the problem, but do they tell us why it’s happening? Not always.\n \nThat’s where solid observability comes in…",

          "description": "Microsoft is looking to enable TLS 1.3 for Azure Service Bus, and Azure Event Hubs.  We found however that there is a problem with some clients that use both Java and our AMQP or JMS interfaces.  Java clients that use Apache Proton-J with a version older than proton-j-0.31.0 along with Java 11+ can't support TLS 1.3.  The Proton-J library is used in AMQP and JMS implementations. The nature of the problem lies in the handshake and is thus not detectable by our application layer.  This means that we can't detect and work around the issue from the service side.  To avoid this problem, customers need to update any instances of Apache Proton-J that have a version older than proton-j-0.31.0.  The link for the Proton-J issue is tracked at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PROTON-1972\n \nRequired action\nProton-J may also be in a dependent library and may not be directly used by your code. To determine if you have an incompatibility with TLS 1.3, we have enabled the West Central US region with TLS 1.3 support for AMQP traffic.  To test if you have a compatibility issue\n\nfirst evaluate if you are using AMQP or JMS\nSecond, determine if you are using Java 11+ with your client code\nThird, if you are using AMQP or JMS and also Java 11+, then create a namespace in West Central US and attempt to connect to it with your code. \n\nIf your client fails to connect, you need to find where you are using Proton-J and get the version used updated to a version that is newer than proton-j-0.30.0.\n \nTimeline\nAs already noted, this only affects AMQP or JMS traffic.  It does not affect web service or Kafka traffic which does have TLS 1.3 enabled now.  We are going to enable TLS 1.3 for AMQP and JMS on October 31, 2024.  That is also the same day that TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 is being removed from Azure Event Hubs and Azure Service Bus.  Please take action as soon as possible to guarantee no interruption to your service use when we enable TLS 1.3.",

Logs can provide help in tracking security related events, can be used for auditing, troubleshooting and more. In Windows, logs that are saved contain information about applications and the operating system itself. Moreover, these logs are structured and human-readable. For viewing the logs, Windows uses its Windows Event Viewer.\n \n\n \nThere are five main categories under Windows logs:\n\nSystem - Logs created by the operating system.\nApplication- Logged by an application hosted locally.\nSetup - Logs created in the process of installing or changing the Windows installation.\nSecurity - Logs related to logins, privileges, and other similar events.\nForwarded Events - Events forwarded by other computers.\n\n …",

If your data is bad, the outputs won't be good. The short version of this is Garbage in - Garbage out which is definitely shorter and easier to remember. A good prompt is often the key for a good answer.

They cannot be trusted to keep secrets or guarantee their integrity. (Which is why you also see server side frontend components.)

          "description": "In real time, the column names from source might not be uniform, some columns will have a space in it, some other columns will not.\nFor example,\n\nSales Channel\nItem Type,\nRegion\nCountry\nUnit Price\n\nIt is a good practice to replace all the spaces in a column name before doing any transformation for easy handling. This also helps with auto mapping, when the sink column names do not come with spaces!\n \nSelect transformation in data flow makes it simpler to automatically detect spaces in column names and then remove them for the rest of the dataflow.\n \nConsider the below source, with the given column names.\n \n\n \nHere as we can see, few columns have spaces, few columns like Region and Country do not have spaces in it. \n \nUsing the below configuration in select transformation, we can get rid of the spaces in the column names with a simple expression. \n \nIn the Input columns, Click on Add mapping button, and choose Rule-based Mapping.\n\nThen give the below expression:\non Source1's column: true()\non Name as column: replace($$,' ','')\n \n\nWhat it does? \nIt will return true() for all the columns which have ' ' (space) in it and replace it with '' (no space).\nUpon data preview, we get to see the below result,\n \n\n \nAs we are seeing here, all the columns with spaces are coming without spaces in between. \nIf not for the Rule based mapping, one would have to manually remove space from all the columns. It would be a nightmare if the number of columns are more! Thanks to rule-based mapping!",

What separates this from a more generic tutorial on Azure infra?

You can certainly build on this or re-use for other purposes, but this isn't about creating a complete platform as such.\n \nDisclaimer: While I strive to follow best practices the focus is on the concepts and not a battle hardened solution.

          "description": "Azure provides a comprehensive list of built-in policy definitions (grouped by the category property defined in the metadata) which are owned and maintained by Microsoft (where the azure-policy repository contains the direct representation of these).\n \nBuilt-in policy definitions usually cover a specific scenario although some flexibility might be provided through parameters that can be configured. However, customers might have specific needs not covered by an available built-in policy definition and a custom policy definition might be needed.\n \nAs a rule of thumb, if there is a built-in policy definition that covers part of a scenario, a custom policy definition can be created based on it introducing the necessary modifications.\n \nLet’s take into consideration the [Preview]: Assign Built-In User-Assigned Managed Identity to Virtual Machines built-in policy definition that creates and assigns a built-in user-assigned managed identity or assigns a pre-created user-assigned managed identity at scale to virtual machines. This currently provides the user-assigned managed identity name and resource group name as parameters expecting that it is on the same subscription as the virtual machine resource. However, in a scenario where the pre-created user-assigned managed identity exists in a different subscription from the virtual machine resource, a custom policy definition is required.\n \nBefore creating a custom policy, it is worth checking both the Azure Policy Samples as well as the Community Policy Repository to see whether a policy definition that matches your needs already exists. Coming back to the user-assigned managed identity assignment to virtual machines where the pre-created user-assigned managed identity exists in a different subscription from the virtual machine resource scenario, a custom policy definition is available here where the user assigned managed identity resource URI (which contains the subscription ID) is provided as a parameter.",

It involves strategic measures to reduce costs while maximizing the value derived from ingested, processed, and retained data. In Azure, achieving this balance entails adopting efficient data ingestion methods, smart retention policies, and judicious use of table transformations with Kusto Query Language (KQL).\nUnderstanding the impact of data management practices on costs is crucial since each byte of data ingested and stored in Azure Log Analytics incurs expenses.

          "description": "Thank you to about two dozen colleagues who offered feedback.\n \nOur goal is to make Azure the most observable cloud. To that end, we are refactoring Azure’s native observability platform to be based on OpenTelemetry, an industry standard for instrumenting applications and transmitting telemetry.\n \nMicrosoft decided to take a bet on OpenTelemetry in 2019. We are among the top contributors to OpenTelemetry. Initially, our motivation was to converge fragmented telemetry instrumentation across Microsoft, standardize on OpenTelemetry APIs, and expand our data collection offerings to new programming and frameworks.\n \nAs OpenTelemetry gained momentum and became more mature, customers asked for OpenTelemetry compatibility in downstream agents and service endpoints. As a result, we have significant…",
