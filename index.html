                              <span>Over the past few months, we gradually rolled out the new Log Analytics experience to our users. The feedback has been positive, and the telemetry shows that users are more successful at working with their data. Today, we’re excited to announce that the new Log Analytics experience, including Simple Mode and other improvements, is now fully available and enabled by default. 
How simple is it? Here are two quick examples: 
Investigate Workspace Usage: 

Double-click the Usage table to load the latest data. 
Add an Aggregate operation to sum the Quantity column by DataType.
Add a Sort operation by Quantity, and instantly see the results organized. 
At the top-right, click the three dots and create a New Alert Rule. 


 
Troubleshoot Kubernetes Pods: 

Select the KubePodInventory table and click Run to view the latest data. 
Filter the PodStatus column to Pending. 
Add an Aggregate operator to count the failed pods by Name. 
Click Share and export the results to CSV.  


That’s it - just a few clicks, and you’ve gained meaningful insights!  
Seamless Transition for Advanced Users 
If you’re comfortable with Kusto Query Language (KQL), you can switch to KQL Mode, edit the auto-generated query, and dive deeper. Once done, you can switch back to Simple Mode to continue exploring with updated results. You can also set your preferred default mode through the Settings menu for a customized experience. 
Improved Usability
The interface includes organized menus for key actions like Save, Share, and Export, and a collapsible pane for quick access to tables, saved queries, examples, and more. 
To dive deeper into Simple Mode and other recent updates, visit our official documentation.   
Your Feedback Matters 
We’re committed to continuously improving Log Analytics to meet our users’ needs. Your input is invaluable in shaping its capabilities and user experience.

                              <span>Two-factor authentication (2FA) has become a cornerstone of modern digital security, serving as a crucial defense against unauthorized access and account compromises. While many organizations rely on popular authenticator apps like Microsoft Authenticator, there&#x27;s significant value in understanding how to build and customize your own TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) solution. This becomes particularly relevant for those requiring specific customizations, enhanced security controls, or seamless integration with existing systems.
In this blog, I&#x27;ll walk through building a TOTP authenticator application using Azure&#x27;s modern cloud services. Our solution demonstrates using Azure Functions for server-side operations with Azure Key Vault for secrets management. A bonus section covers integrati…</span>

On the .NET side we&#x27;ve seen good things with standards compliant libraries provided by Microsoft.

                              <span>Introduction
In modern cloud applications, managing different environments (such as development, staging, and production) is crucial for ensuring smooth deployment and testing workflows.
Azure Container Apps offers a powerful feature through labels and traffic splitting that can help developers easily manage multiple versions of an app, route traffic based on different environments, and enable controlled feature testing without disrupting live users.
In this blog, we&#x27;ll walk through a practical scenario where we deploy an experimental feature in a staging revision, test it with internal developers, and then switch the feature to production once it’s validated. We&#x27;ll use Azure Container Apps labels and traffic splitting to achieve this seamless deployment process.
Note: labels is a feature …</span>

                              <span>AI Toolkit is a VS Code extension aiming to empower AI engineers in transforming their curiosity into advanced generative AI applications. This toolkit, featuring both local-enabled and cloud-accelerated inner loop capabilities, is set to ease model exploration, prompt engineering, and the creation and evaluation of generative applications. We are pleased to announce the January Update to the toolkit with support for OpenAI&#x27;s o1 model and enhancements in the Model Playground and Bulk Run features.
What&#x27;s New?
January’s update brings several exciting new features to boost your productivity in AI development. Here&#x27;s a closer look at what&#x27;s included:

Support for OpenAI’s new o1 Model: We&#x27;ve added access to GitHub hosted OpenAI’s latest o1 model. This new model replaces the o1-preview and offers even better performance in handling complex tasks. You can start interacting with the o1 model within VS Code for free by using the latest AI Toolkit update.
Chat History Support in Model Playground: We have heard your feedback that tracking past model interactions is crucial. The Model Playground has been updated to include support for chat history. This feature saves chat history as individual files stored entirely on your local machine, ensuring privacy and security.
Bulk Run with Prompt Templating: The Bulk Run feature, introduced in the AI Toolkit December release, now supports prompt templating with variables. This allows users to create templates for prompts, insert variables, and run them in bulk. This enhancement simplifies the process of testing multiple scenarios and models.

Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements as we continue to innovate and support your journey in AI development. Try out the AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code, share your thoughts, and file issues and suggest features in our GitHub repo. Thank you for being a part of this journey with us!</span>

Como los llama Bruno Capuano en un video, &quot;pequeños hechizos mágicos&quot;; en otras palabras, al escribir una barra diagonal (/) en un símbolo del sistema de GitHub Copilot, se abre una opción en la que puede elegir algunos comandos que tendrán una acción predefinida.

Para abrir el menú de comandos de barra diagonal, puedes hacer clic en el botón Barra diagonal dentro de la ventana de chat de GitHub Copilot, como se muestra en la imagen inferior.

                              <span>Cuando creas un nuevo proyecto desde cero en Visual Studio, algunos archivos se crean. Hay muchas plantillas disponibles, para muchos tipos de aplicaciones, desde aplicaciones simples hasta aplicaciones web complejas, así como aplicaciones móviles, sin servidor y muchas más.
Todos estos proyectos constan de varios archivos. Tienes tus archivos de código, que contienen el software que se ejecutará, organizados en clases, frecuentemente cada clase en su propio archivo. Tienes los archivos de configuración, ya sea JSON, XML, YAML u otros. Incluso puedes tener archivos de datos, incrustados en la aplicación cuando está construida.
En un video que se publicó, mi compañera Gwyn muestra cómo puedes usar el atajo Hash (#) para hacer referencia a otro archivo.

For example, a user can connect by Remote Desktop (RDP) on port 3389 to a compute node in a Windows pool. Similarly, by default, a user can connect by Secure Shell (SSH) to port 22 to a compute node in a Linux pool.
As of API version 2024-07-01 (and all pools created after 30 November 2025 regardless of API version), Batch no longer automatically maps common remote access ports for SSH and RDP. If you wish to allow remote access to your Batch compute nodes with pools created with API version 2024-07-01 or later (and after 30 November 2025), then you must manually configure the pool endpoint configuration to enable such access.

                              <span>From our own metadata and experience at Microsoft, we know that a considerable number of our customers use App Service behind one of our reverse proxy solutions, such as Azure Application Gateway or Azure Front Door.
In simple terms, this means that when our customers have an App Service, it often runs as part of the backend pool of an Azure Application Gateway or is configured as the origin in an Azure Front Door profile, which is great because this setup is beneficial for several reasons.
Firstly, it enhances security by obfuscation. With a reverse proxy in the data path, clients only contact the reverse proxy instances and are unaware of the second connection between the reverse proxy instances and the real backend.

Los comandos de barra (slash), &quot;hechizos mágicos&quot; para Visual Studio
Estos pueden aparecer escribiendo la barra diagonal &#x27;/&#x27; (slash command) en el chat de GitHub Copilot en Visual Studio. Luego, se abrirá un menú donde puede seleccionar un comando, por ejemplo, /fix para arreglar algún código, o /optimize. También tenemos /doc que, como su nombre indica, te ayudara a crear documentación para el código seleccionado, por ejemplo, un método o una propiedad.

                              <span>Problem Domain
As usage of Azure DevOps organisations grow so do the number of projects, repositories, pipelines and agent pools used. With new services available such as Managed DevOps Pools it can appear a mammoth task for central IT function to manually trawl through every pipeline noting down each agentpool being used. Replacing these values potentially even more complicated after creating the new agent pools and mapping them with potential for human error.
Solution
As there is no built in reporting for this at the moment I have built a bespoke bash script that can be ran to generate a report and optionally replace the values in each pipeline for a new agentpool.
 
The tool is in this repository: https://github.com/owainow/azure_devops_agentpool_report_and_replace

In this blog post I document my experience of spending a full day using KAITO and Copilot to accelerate deployment and development of a self managed AI enabled chatbot deployed in a managed cluster. The goal is to showcase how quickly using a mix of AI tooling we can go from zero to a self hosted, tuned LLM and chatbot application. 
At the top of this article I want to share my perspective on the future of projects such as KAITO. At the moment I believe KAITO to be somewhat ahead of its time, as most enterprises begin adopting abstracted artificial intelligence it is brilliant to see projects like KAITO being developed ready for the eventual abstraction pendulum to swing back, motivated by usual factors such as increased skills in the market, cost and governance.

                              <span>GitHub Copilot can be used to improve developers&#x27; programming efficiency with AI. Different chat participants can also enable developers to complete AI empowerment in different scenarios. For example, @workspace can not only create simple projects and notebooks, but also help you maintain project code and generate test environments. You can enter /help in GitHub Copilot Chat to learn about the chat participants that come with the system. Of course, you can also customize various chat participants for your own workflow. Now you can customize chat participants based on Visual Studio Code Chat Extension, or you can directly create Copilot Extensions to support more IDE applications.
Note: This blog focuses on the chat extension of Visual Studio Code.

                              <span>This latest update empowers you to easily create load tests and analyze results with enhanced insight. This CLI release now includes features like those previously available in Azure Portal or CI/CD. The following is a list of capabilities included in this CLI update:
Multi-Region Load Testing
Scale your tests globally with the new multi-region support! This feature allows you to distribute load across up to eight regions, helping you assess application performance under real-world, distributed traffic scenarios.
Command Example:
az load test create --test-id sample-test-id --load-test-resource sample-alt-resource --resource-group sample-rg --engine-instances 3 --regionwise-engines eastus&#x3D;1 westus2&#x3D;1 germanywestcentral&#x3D;1 --test-plan sample-jmx.jmx

                              <span>Currently, viewing your Java or Java WebServer version on Linux is typically a two-step process involving first creating a remote connection, and then connecting to the remote connection to view your web app&#x27;s info. Note that these steps do NOT work on App Service Windows applications, this applies only to App Service Linux.
Viewing your minor and patch version on App Service Linux for Java applications is possible by first setting up a remote connection to your Linux webapp by running the following command:
az webapp create-remote-connection -g {RESOURCE_GROUP} -n {WEBAPP_NAME}
This will result in something like this:

After creating the remote connection, we can connect to the webapp and view the info we’re looking for. Using another terminal window, to connect to our remote connection run the following command:
ssh root@127.0.0.1 -m hmac-sha1 -p {PORT_NUMBER}
After entering the password shown in the previous step, we will now have shell access to the web app. Now we can view our Java and webserver version.
To view Java version:
java -version
To view Tomcat version:
sh /usr/local/tomcat/version.sh
If your Tomcat Webserver is in a different location, we can locate it by running:
find / -name &quot;version.sh&quot;
To connect and view Java version with one command:
ssh root@127.0.0.1 -m hmac-sha1 -p {PORT_NUMBER} /usr/lib/jdk/bin/java -version
To connect and view Tomcat version with one command:
ssh root@127.0.0.1 -m hmac-sha1 -p {PORT_NUMBER} sh /usr/local/tomcat/version.sh</span>

GitHub Copilot es un asistente de programación impulsado por Inteligencia Artificial (IA) que puede ejecutarse en varios entornos, ayudándote a ser más eficiente en tus tareas diarias de programación. En este blog, te mostraremos específicamente cómo funciona GitHub Copilot en Visual Studio y cómo puede aumentar tu productividad.
Comprendiendo la diferencia entre GitHub Copilot y GitHub Copilot Chat:
GitHub Copilot funciona directamente en tus archivos de código, proporcionando sugerencias para tu código. Funciona de manera similar a IntelliSense, pero es capaz de proponer bloques completos de código en base a lo que estás escribiendo. También proporciona acceso a comandos, puede explicar el código y ofrecer funciones adicionales directamente respecto a tus archivos.
GitHub Copilot Chat funciona en una ventana independiente dentro del entorno de Visual Studio. Proporciona un asistente de chat que puede recordar el contexto de la conversación y ofrecer sugerencias inteligentes.
Ambas extensiones se pueden instalar por separado. Te recomendamos probar ambas para que puedas elegir la que prefieras. En próximas oportunidades, te mostraremos más detalles sobre cada una de estas extensiones.
Instalando las extensiones de GitHub Copilot
Ambas extensiones se pueden instalar directamente desde Visual Studio, a través del menú Extensiones / Administrar extensiones. Desde allí, busca GitHub Copilot y GitHub Copilot Chat.

También puedes dirigirte a Visual Studio Marketplace, que contiene una gran cantidad de extensiones para mejorar tu experiencia con Visual Studio.
Ten en cuenta que GitHub Copilot requiere Visual Studio 2022 17.5.5 o posterior.

                              <span>Setting up the Project
Before we dive into the implementation, let’s set up the basic structure:

Create an ASP.NET Core Web API project.
Add the Azure.Storage.BlobsNuGet Package for Azure Blob Storage integration.
Update appsettings.json to include storage configurations:

&quot;Storage&quot;: {
    &quot;Mode&quot;: &quot;Local&quot;,
    &quot;BlobStorage&quot;: {
        &quot;ConnectionString&quot;: &quot;YourAzureBlobStorageConnectionString&quot;,
        &quot;ContainerName&quot;: &quot;YourContainerName&quot;
    }
}
Mode: Determines whether to use Local or Azure Blob Storage.
ConnectionString and ContainerName: Azure Blob Storage details.

Implementing the Storage Service
Here is a custom StorageService that handles file uploads, deletions, and downloads. It dynamically decides the storage location based on the configuration mode.

What is Azure API management?
If you&#x27;re completely new to Azure API management, it&#x27;s a service that allows you to create, publish, and manage APIs in a secure and scalable way. With Azure API management, you can expose your APIs to external developers, partners, and internal teams, and monitor and analyze their usage. Additionally it also has a great story around generative AI and how you can take these APIs to production. How you might wonder?

                              <span>The Need
Sometimes it is useful to call APIs hosted in Azure App Service that has been configured to use Easy Auth.
By default Easy Auth allows the web application itself to be authenticated in a browser. This redirects to Microsoft Entra to then allow the user to enter their credentials. The application is then authenticated and any APIs hosted in the App Service can then be used.
Sometimes it may be useful to call these APIs programmatically from code, VS Code or Postman. This opens up the possibility of driving the APIs hosted in App Service programmatically. This can be very useful for testing generative AI solution accelerators automatically.
The Problem
When attempting to access the App Service hosted APIs, firstly an authentication flow needs to be executed to gain an access token a…</span>

                              <span>When building secure and scalable applications on Microsoft Azure, network connectivity becomes a critical factor. Azure provides two primary methods for enhancing security and connectivity: Private Endpoints and Service Endpoints. While both serve to establish secure connections to Azure resources, they function in distinct ways and cater to different networking needs. This blog will explain the differences between the two, their use cases, and when you should use each.

 Understanding Service Endpoints

Azure Service Endpoints allow you to securely connect to Azure services over an optimized route through the Azure backbone network. When you enable service endpoints on a virtual network, they extend the private IP address space of that virtual network to the service. Essentially, they pr…</span>

Platform or resource metrics are telemetry data automatically collected by Azure Monitor for resources running within the Azure environment. These metrics include performance indicators such as CPU usage, memory consumption, network traffic, and disk I/O, which are critical for resource monitoring and performance tuning.
For Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), platform metrics provide insights into both the Kubernetes cluster and its underlying infrastructure. Examples include:

Node metrics: CPU utilization, memory usage
Pod metrics: Pod status
Control plane metrics: API server inflight requests

These metrics enable administrators and developers to monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize their applications effectively. The list of platform metrics for AKS is available h…</span>

Say goodbye to constantly running Spark clusters! With the shared metadata functionality, you can shut down your Spark pools while still be able to query your Spark external tables using Serverless SQL Pool.
In this blog we dive into, how Serverless SQL Pool streamlines your data workflow by automatically synchronizing metadata from your Spark pools.
Shared Metadata functionality
Azure Synapse Analytics allows the different workspace computational engines to share databases and tables between its Apache Spark pools and serverless SQL pool.
When we create tables in Apache Spark Pool, whether managed or external, the Serverless SQL pool automatically synchronizes its metadata. This metadata synchronization automatically creates a corresponding external table in a serverless SQL pool database. Then after a short delay, we can see the table in our Serverless SQL pool.
Creating a managed table in Spark and querying from Serverless SQL Pool

Now we can shut down our Spark pools and still be able to query Spark external tables from Serverless SQL Pool.


NOTE: Azure Synapse currently only shares managed and external Spark tables that store their data in Parquet, DELTA, or CSV format. Tables backed by other formats are not automatically synced. 
You may be able to sync such tables explicitly yourself as an external table in your own SQL database if the SQL engine supports the table&#x27;s underlying format.
Also, External tables created in Spark are not available in dedicated SQL pool databases.

Why we get an error if you use dbo schema in Spark pool or if you don’t use dbo schema in Serverless SQL pool?
The dbo schema (short for “database owner”) is the default schema in SQL Server and Azure Synapse SQL pools.
Spark pool only supports user-defined schemas. Means, it does not recognize dbo as a valid schema name. While in Serverless SQL Pool, all the tables belong to the dbo schema, regardless of their original schema in Spark pool or other sources.</span>

                              <span>Building a robust software licensing system requires careful consideration of cryptographic security, attack vectors, and implementation details. While many licensing systems rely on simple API calls or basic key validation, creating a more secure system demands a deeper understanding of cryptographic principles and secure communication patterns.
At its core, a secure licensing system must solve several fundamental challenges. How do we ensure that validation responses haven&#x27;t been tampered with? How can we prevent replay attacks where valid responses are captured and reused? This article will present a robust solution to these challenges using cryptographic signatures, nonce validation, and secure key management. However, it&#x27;s important to acknowledge an uncomfortable truth: no licensing …</span>

Azure Synapse Dedicated SQL pool or SQL Server or Azure SQL Database, allows you to create partitions on a target table. Table partitions enable you to divide your data into multiple chunks or partitions. It improves query performance by eliminating partitions that is not necessary. In most cases partitions are built on date column.
Why don&#x27;t we simply drop the unwanted Partition?
because of several regions:

Clustered Columnstore Index: Dropping a partition directly can potentially lead to performance degradation, especially with a CCI. This is because CCIs are optimised for data locality and dropping a partition disrupts that organisation. Rebuilding the CCI after dropping the partition would be required, which can be time-consuming for a large table.…</span>

While creating a job scheduler, you will see Job Specification section. In this section, you would need to update Job configuration task to add jobs.

You will further see below settings.

 
To add tasks to the Job in the job scheduler, you would need to add Job manager task. A job manager task contains the information that is necessary to create the required tasks for a job. A job manager task is required for jobs that are created by a  job schedule, because it is the only way to define the tasks before the job is instantiated.

Introduction
When using the Graph API to manage mail-related services, setting the permission to Delegate permission restricts the authorization to the user’s identity, limiting management to the specific user’s mailbox. While this might not be sufficient for certain business scenarios, Application permission, on the other hand, allows authorization under the App’s identity, enabling access to all users’ mailboxes within the tenant, which could be overly broad for certain use cases.
Therefore, a method is required that allows the management of a specific mailbox using the App’s identity.
This scenario is not recommended to use Delegate permission and requires some prerequisites, which are …</span>

Granting list-only permissions to specific users for an Azure Storage container path allows them to list files and directories without reading or downloading their contents. While RBAC manages access at the container or account level, ABAC offers more granular control by leveraging attributes like resource metadata, user roles, or environmental factors, enabling customized access policies to meet specific requirements.

In late 2024, Microsoft Entra enforced MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for all user login processes. This change has caused some Web Apps using delegated permissions to fail in acquiring access tokens, thereby interrupting communication with O365 resources. This tutorial will present various alternative solutions tailored to different business requirements.

Introduction
The Resilient Ecommerce Reference Application is a synthetic workload that mirrors a simple, bare-bones, e-commerce platform. The purpose of it is to demonstrate how to use Azure Resiliency best practices to achieve availability during zonal outages or components outages.
The application has been tested for resiliency during simulated zonal outages and has performed as expected, keeping a high availability of the service with minimal impact to end users. Currently, it is being used by internal Microsoft teams for regression testing and new region buildouts, providing valuable telemetry to Azure service owners with regards to availability, recovery…</span>

The assets of a bank are only accessible to some high-ranking officials, and even they don&#x27;t have access to individual user lockers. These privacy features help build trust among customers. The same goes with in our IT world. Every user wants their sensitive data to be accessible only to themselves, not even available to those with higher privileges within the company. So, as you move data to the cloud, securing the data assets is critical to building trust with your customers and partners.
To enable these kinds of preventions, Azure Synapse supports a wide range of advanced access control features to control who can access what data. These features are:

Object-level security
Row-level security
Column-level security
Dynamic data masking
Synapse role-based access control

                              <span>While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 dominate headlines with their extensive capabilities, they often come at the cost of high computational requirements and complexity. For developers and organizations looking to implement AI solutions on edge devices or with limited resources, Small Language Models (SLMs) are emerging as a practical alternative.
SLMs are not just &quot;smaller&quot; versions of their larger counterparts—they&#x27;re designed to be faster, more efficient, and adaptable for specific tasks. With fewer parameters and lower computational needs, SLMs open the door to deploying AI on mobile devices, IoT systems, and edge environments without compromising performance.

By the end of this tutorial, you&#x27;ll have a solid understanding of how to integrate Azure Cosmos DB into your TypeScript applications.
What is an SDK?
An SDK (Software Development Kit) is a collection of software development tools, libraries, and documentation that helps developers integrate and interact with a service or platform. In this case, the Azure Cosmos DB SDK for JavaScript/TypeScript provides a set of tools to interact with the Cosmos DB service, making it easier to perform operations like database an…</span>

                              <span>Introduction
In many enterprise environments, it&#x27;s common for organizations to have multiple Azure tenants, each serving different teams, projects, or departments. While this segregation adds a layer of security and control, it can also introduce challenges, especially when resources need to interact across these tenants. 
 
One common scenario is when developers need their Azure Container App in one tenant to pull container images from an Azure Container Registry (ACR) located in another tenant. This is particularly useful for organizations that centralize their container images in a shared registry, perhaps managed by a DevOps team, while allowing individual teams from different tenants to deploy applications using those images. So let’s dive into how you can set this up seamlessly.

                              <span>Earlier this year, the Office Platform Team announced that Exchange Online legacy tokens are deprecated and will be turned off. This is part of Microsoft’s Secure Future Initiative (SFI) to give organizations the tools they need in the current threat landscape. We’ll begin turning off legacy tokens in February 2025. Publishers and developers are actively migrating their Outlook add-ins to use Entra ID tokens through nested app authentication (NAA) and Microsoft Graph instead of legacy tokens.

                              <span>Microsoft Azure is a great destination for Java applications, and our goal is to help Java developers easily onboard their applications to Azure.
We understand that onboarding Java apps to Azure is not only about deploying Java apps but also includes the provisioning of dependent services like databases, messaging services as well as compute services like Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Application Service, Azure Container Apps, etc. Java developers new to Azure often use either the Azure CLI or the Azure Portal to provision necessary Azure services. This requires learning many different CLI commands, different Portal experiences, and even different infrastructure-as code languages such as Bicep or Terraform.

Decision makers agree with us: A recent Forrester study of over 500 business leaders found 89% of enterprises accelerating or maintaining investments in app modernization over the next year. 
This blog focuses on how teams can scale AI transformation through app modernization and targeted upskilling.

In today&#x27;s fast-paced business environment, meetings are essential but often leave teams scrambling to document discussions and action items. Many organizations struggle with inconsistent note taking, delayed follow-ups and important details falling through the cracks. This challenge becomes even more pronounced in remote and hybrid work environments where clear communication is paramount. 
In this tutorial, we will build a Microsoft Teams bot that transforms meetings into polished summary documents automatically. The bot captures meeting transcripts, uses Azure OpenAI to generate professionally formatted Word documents with executive summaries, key points, and action items, and emails these documents to participants using Azure Communication Services.

After performing transformation on data, then it needs to save it in Data Warehouse for further analysis. This process comes under ETL (Extract, Transform, Load). It involves extracting data from various sources, transforming it as per business need, and then loading it into destination.
There are many ways to load data in DW: -

POLYBASE
COPY INTO command
ADF Copy activity
Spark Pool in Synapse
Databricks

In this blog I will explain these processes and talk about some limitations of some activity and its workaround.

NOTE: Whenever we use other tools for inserting data in Synapse like ADF, Data Flow, Spark Pool and Databricks, it highly recommended to enable staging or under hood it can be implemented automatically. It allows for efficient data transfer and can handle large …</span>

                              <span>Overview:
The blobfuse2 functionality is used to mount Azure Storage Account as file system on Linux machine. To establish the connection with storage account via blobfuse2 and to authenticate the request against the storage account, we make use of configuration file for it. The configuration file contains the storage account details along with the container to be mounted and what mode of authentication to be used. The configuration yaml file includes parameters for blobfuse2 settings. 
In general, the details saved in configuration file are in plain text. Hence, if any users access the configuration file, they would be able to access the sensitive information related to the storage account, like for example, the storage account access keys and SAS token.

Struggling with Time-Consuming Translation Tasks?
Translating open-source projects is often more than just translating text—it’s about adapting and reorganizing. Developers must update README files with links to translated versions, manually adjust relative paths in Markdown files, and ensure every link correctly points to its translated or original target. For technical documentation with extensive links or intricate structures, this process can be overwhelming and error-prone.

                              <span>When building modern applications, there are often situations where you want to perform tasks in the background without holding up the main flow of your application. This is where “fire-and-forget” methods come into play. In C#, a fire-and-forget method allows you to run a task without awaiting its completion.
A common use case is sending a confirmation email after creating a user, but this also brings some limitations, particularly when dealing with scoped services. In this blog, we’ll walk through an example and explain why scoped services, like database contexts or HTTP clients, cannot be accessed in fire-and-forget methods.
Why Fire-and-Forget?
Fire-and-forget is useful in situations where you don’t need the result of an operation immediately, and it can happen in the background, for e…</span>

                              <span>Today at Ignite, we are thrilled to announce the General Availability of Kubernetes Metadata and Logs Filtering in Azure Monitor – Container Insights! This enhancement brings additional Kubernetes metadata to the ContainerLogsV2 schema, including PodLabels, PodAnnotations, PodUid, Image, ImageID, ImageRepo, and ImageTag. Moreover, the new Logs Filtering feature allows for precise filtering of both workload and system pods/containers. These advancements not only provide users with richer context and enhanced visibility into their workloads but are crucial for customer troubleshooting as they provide deeper insights into the Kubernetes environment.
Key Features

Enhanced ContainerLogV2 schema with Kubernetes Metadata Fields: Detailed metadata fields enhance log analysis. These include “podLabels,” “podAnnotations,” “podUid,” “image,” “imageID,” “imageRepo,” and “imageTag.”
Customized Include List Configuration: Users can tailor metadata fields via ConfigMap. All fields are collected by default.
Enhanced ContainerLogV2 schema with Log Level: Assess application health with color-coded severity levels (e.g., CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING). Helps incident response and proactive monitoring.
Annotation Based Log Filtering for workloads: Efficient log filtering through podAnnotations. Focus on relevant information, optimizing costs and resource usage.
ConfigMap Based Log Filtering for platform logs (System Kubernetes Namespaces): Enables ability to configure log collection of specific pods within the system namespaces through ConfigMap.
Grafana Dashboard for Visualization: Leverage the power of Grafana Dashboard to visualize log levels, log volume, rate, records, and more. Empowers in-depth analysis and real-time monitoring. 


To learn more and enable this new feature, please visit our Kubernetes Metadata and Logs Filtering Documentation.

                              <span>Azure Event Hubs is a cloud-native data streaming service that streams millions of events per second with low latency, from any source to any destination. Compatible with Apache Kafka®, it allows you to run existing Kafka workloads without code changes. 
Earlier this year, we released the Event Hubs emulator for local development, which initially only supported AMQP protocol. We are now excited to announce Apache Kafka® protocol support in the Event Hubs emulator.

Durable Functions lets developers write stateful orchestrations (sometimes referred to as workflows) within Azure Functions, Azure&#x27;s serverless compute. Orchestrations allow developers to define sequential and/or parallel tasks for arbitrarily long-running business processes, something that is otherwise challenging to do in serverless. The orchestration state is durably persisted so that it may be recovered in the event of errors, which means developers do not have to architect for fault tolerance themselves.

This feature works similarly for both Web Apps and Functions, so you can refer to the Public Preview announcement for more in-depth information regarding this feature.   
Secure unique default hostname feature is a long-term solution to protect your resources from dangling DNS entries and subdomain takeover. If you have this feature enabled for your App Service resources, then no one outside of your organization would be able to recreate resources with the same default hostname.

                              <span>Introduction
The journey to the cloud is an essential step for modern enterprises looking to leverage the benefits of scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. A crucial part of this transformation is understanding the current state of your IT infrastructure, including workloads, applications, and their interdependencies. Often, organizations aim to set their migration goals based on the applications they want to move to the cloud, rather than focusing on individual servers or databases in isolation.
I am thrilled to share that Azure Migrate is evolving to both simplify and enrich your cloud adoption journey. We are introducing new capabilities in Azure Migrate to help you achieve your goals.

                              <span>We are thrilled to announce that Conversational Diagnostics (Public Preview) is coming to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)! This new functionality will be available in the &quot;Diagnose and solve problems&quot; section of the Azure Portal, starting at Ignite 2024.
Diagnose and Solve Problems with Conversational Diagnostics
Conversational Diagnostics leverages natural language processing to help you troubleshoot and resolve issues with your AKS clusters more efficiently. By simply describing your problem in plain language, you can get targeted diagnostics and solutions, making it easier to maintain the health and performance of your AKS deployments.
In Azure Portal under the Diagnose and solve problems the GIF is demonstrating Conversational Diagnostics, which uses natural language, to diagnose problems with an AKS cluster related to CPU Pressure on the nodes.
Availability and Future Developments
Conversational Diagnostics (Public Preview) for AKS will be available as part of Ignite 2024. Shortly after, the AKS + Conversational Diagnostics (Public Preview) integration will expand to Copilot in Azure and GitHub Copilot via azure.
 
With the integration of Conversational Diagnostics into Copilot in Azure, you can now access powerful diagnostic tools from anywhere in Azure Portal allowing you to quickly identify and resolve issues without leaving your workflow, enhancing productivity, and reducing downtime.
 
The expansion of Conversational Diagnostics to GitHub Copilot means that developers can now benefit from advanced troubleshooting capabilities while writing code, providing near real-time diagnostics and suggestions to help catch and fix issues early in the development process.
 
Stay tuned for more updates and detailed demonstrations at Ignite 2024. We look forward to seeing how Conversational Diagnostics will transform the way you manage and troubleshoot your AKS clusters.

                              <span>Introduction to Secure Remote Access with Azure Relay and Azbridge
In modern IT environments, securely accessing on-premises resources from remote locations is a common challenge. Traditional methods, such as setting up VPNs, often require complex configurations and can introduce significant overhead. For organizations seeking a more streamlined solution, Azure Relay, combined with the open-source tool Azure Relay Bridge (azbridge), offers an efficient way to establish secure, direct connections without the need for VPNs.
Azbridge leverages Azure Relay to create TCP, UDP, HTTP, and Unix Socket tunnels, enabling secure traversal through NATs and firewalls using only outbound HTTPS (443) connectivity. This makes it ideal for connecting remote clients to on-premises resources, such as Remote …</span>

This solution shows how data from a CRM can be used as the grounding data in a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pattern. The AI assistant can help resolve or suggest resolutions for customer requests using language models from Azure OpenAI with customer data from Dataverse or any other CRM solution. CRM data can be used for situations such as:

Clarification or information pertaining to the service offered
Customer complains on any issue with the service they received
A refund or warranty claim on a service or product is requested

This application understands the request, potentially as multi-modal with text, voice, images, and generates human-like responses. The solution supports summarization, category classification, sentiment analysis, and suggested next steps.

                              <span>We have completed the rollout for .NET 9 GA support on Azure App Service.
Like in previous years we are using the App Service Early Access feature to enable day-0 support on the platform across all public regions on Azure App Service for Windows. The early access release will be followed by additional deployments to fully integrate the new bits across our fleet, expecting to be fully done by the end of the week.
On Azure App Service for Linux, .NET 9 GA will be fully integrated on day-0 across all public regions without any additional deployments.
If you already have an app targeting an earlier preview of .NET 9.0 on the platform for App Service for Windows, you would need to redeploy the application after updating your runtimeconfig.json to use .NET 9.0.0.
For Azure App Service for Linux,…</span>

Innovations and cost optimization
When migrating to the cloud, the expenses incurred (cost) and the benefits accrued (value) are both important considerations. Balancing costs and value are crucial because it helps organizations make informed decisions that maximize their return on investment (ROI). Among other things, cost calculations may include impact due to loss of business from planned and malicious events. Value in the cloud comes from agility in deploying and scaling and from productivity gains due to innovative technologies and tools.
For optimal performance and return on your investment (ROI), the recommendation is to collocate all IT resources and data in Azure. O…</span>

Speaking to a lot of other developers about their early experiences of web dev, I hear that story again and again. I even have many friends who are accomplished software engineers who don’t want anyone to know that they have never deployed a personal project to the web.  Once you’ve deployed something once, you’ll realise that it’s not so hard to get something up and running on the web, but the world of dev ops is growing and there is aways more to learn about how to manage your deployment.

Throughout the process of building this application, we aimed to implement strategies to adhere to the Microsoft Responsible AI Principles - which provide a foundation for those building AI-enabled applications like ours.  This blog will highlight the steps we took to implement responsible AI within our application, and the key learnings that can be followed by software developers building around AI.

LLM&#x27;s have outdated knowledge and lack internal knowledge
Large Language Models like GPT-3, Llama are trained on vast datasets that include a wide range of publicly available texts. However, they have notable limitations:
 


Lack of Updated Knowledge: LLMs are only as current as the data they were trained on. For instance, if a model was trained on data up to October 2021, it wouldn&#x27;t be aware of developments or facts that emerged after that date. This lack of temporal awareness makes them less effective for tasks requiring up-to-date information.


Outdated Public Knowledge: Even within the timeframe of their training data, LLMs may still rely on outdated or incorrect public information. This is because the data they are trained on reflects the knowledge available at the time…</span>

                              <span>What is Entity Framework?
Entity Framework Core is a lightweight, open-source, cross-platform object-relational mapper for .NET. It acts as a broker between your .NET application and the database server, facilitating the mapping of .NET objects to database tables and translating C# data access code into SQL statements.
Using Entity Framework Core offers several advantages:

No need to learn a new language; utilize C# and LINQ.
Tooling to maintain synchronization between C# models and database tables.
Real-time tracking of changes to C# entities for effective persistence.
Support for multiple database providers.

Now, let’s delve into the process of adding database support to an ASP.NET Core API using Entity Framework Core.

                              <span>What is Materialized View?
Before understanding this, let&#x27;s understand what the Standard View is?
People typically use standard views as a tool that helps organize the logical objects and queries in a database. A standard view computes its data each time when the view is used. Now imagine a scenario where your BI report pulls data from a view connected to multiple tables, with lots of joins and aggregate functions, causing more compute-heavy operations such as shuffles and joins in query execution.
Eventually, these queries will take longer time to complete, particularly on large tables. Now, each time your BI model refreshes, it has to run those same complex queries again, which impacts the performance of your BI report, too.
Here comes Materialized Views; A materialized view pre-computes…</span>

In the cloud-native era, the need for rapid application startup and automated scaling has become more critical, especially for Java applications, which require enhanced solutions to meet these demands effectively. In a previous blog post Accelerating Java Applications on Azure Kubernetes Service with CRaC, we explored using CRaC technology to address these challenges. CRaC enables faster application startup and reduces recovery times, thus facilitating efficient scaling operations. In this blog post, we’ll delve further into optimizing container images specifically for Azure Container Apps (ACA), by leveraging multi-stage builds, Spring Boot Layer Tools, and Class Data Sharing (CDS) to create highly optimized Docker images.

This measured pace is understandable given the critical role domain infrastructure plays in the global internet ecosystem. However, as we stand on the cusp of a new era in web technology, it is becoming increasingly clear that modernization should be a priority. This blog post embarks on a journey to demystify one of the most critical yet often misunderstood components of the industry: the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP).
Throughout this blog, we will dive deep into the intricacies of EPP, exploring its structure, commands and how it fits into the broader domain management system. We will walk through t…</span>

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a technique that enables machines to process and convert human spoken language to written text, and it is widely used in many areas today. However, low inference speed is one of the major challenges in automatic speech recognition.The Project This project aims to investigate the different ways of accelerating inference for the Whisper model, leveraging Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format, with different Runtimes and specialised hardware accelerators like NPUs. This project is a part of the IXN (Industrial Exchange Network) program, which is a teaching framework offering master and undergraduate students opportunities to work with industry companies.

                              <span>In Azure Static Web Apps (SWA), customizing settings is often necessary—for example, modifying headers for specific needs. Although settings can be configured through the staticwebapp.config.json file, its placement (i.e., location) depends on the particular context (such as no framework, pre-built framework, or a framework that will be built during deployment).
 
This tutorial will guide you through where to place staticwebapp.config.json in different scenarios, along with configuration for popular CI/CD tools like Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions.
We will use the Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header as a validation example to confirm that the configurations are working correctly.

                              <span>We are excited to announce the public preview of Socket.IO Serverless Mode in Azure Web PubSub service. This new mode eliminates the need for developers to maintain persistent connections on their application servers, offering a more streamlined and scalable approach. In addition to the existing default mode, developers can now deploy Socket.IO applications in a serverless environment using Azure Functions. This provides a stateless, highly scalable infrastructure, simplifying the development of real-time features while reducing both operational costs and maintenance overhead.
 
What is Socket.IO Serverless Mode? 
In the existing default mode, all Socket.IO clients connect directly to Azure Web PubSub. developers don&#x27;t need to worry about if they have 100 or 1 million concurrent users. The…</span>

While this demo is a full tutorial for deploying an App Service Web App, Database, Managed Identity, and Azure OpenAI, most of the code and instructions for each section can be repurposed for individually unique use-cases. If you already know how to perform some of these actions (there&#x27;s ample documentation on most of this in Microsoft Learn Documentation), feel free to skip ahead and focus on the sections most useful to your needs. Each section builds on the previous, but the code and general principles can be applied to a wide range of applications.

What you need to change:
On Nov 1st, 2025, Azure Blob Storage will stop supporting versions 1.0 and 1.1 of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and TLS 1.2 will become the new minimum TLS version.

It leverages the SQLAlchemy library for Python, integrating Entra&#x27;s secure identity framework with your database connection.
 
Key Steps:

Set Current User as Admin: You begin by configuring an Azure Entra account as the admin for the Azure SQL Server.
Configure Firewall Rules: Ensure that your machine or application has access by adding its IP address to the Azure SQL Server firewall.
Create Secure Connection: Finally, the Python SQLAlchemy library is used to connect to the database, relying on Microsoft Entra authentication instead of hard-coded credentials.

With this setup, we achieve a secure, credenti…</span>

In Azure Storage, Blob Lifecycle Management (BLM) allows you to automate the management of your data based on rules defined by the user. Lifecycle management policies are supported for block blobs and append blobs in general-purpose v2, premium block blob, and Blob Storage accounts. However, since lifecycle management (BLM) policies are not supported for page blobs, we can effectively manage the lifecycle of page blobs and append blobs through storage tasks and actions. There are solutions like Logic Apps and Azure Functions are available to automate lifecycle management and below are reference links:

Kicking Off Azure AI Week!
This week we published a 5-part blog on the Build Intelligent Apps initiative’s #30DaysOfIA series. Our focus was application developers who wanted to build a custom copilot code-first on Azure AI, allowing them to have more control over various decisions made in the end-to-end workflow for generative AI applications.

                              <span>Overcoming Asymmetrical Routing in Azure Virtual WAN: A Collaborative Journey
In the rapidly evolving landscape of cloud networking, professionals often encounter complex challenges that demand innovative solutions. This blog post delves into a recent scenario involving Azure Virtual WAN (VWAN), where a team embarked on a collaborative journey to address asymmetrical routing issues. This case study not only highlights the technical intricacies but also underscores the importance of collaboration and knowledge sharing in the tech community.

 
 
The Challenge:
The core issue revolved around asymmetrical routing within an Azure VWAN architecture, which included two hubs located in different regions. The primary goal was to ensure seamless connectivity between a Palo Alto NGFW in one hub and Panorama in another, without disrupting the existing VPN default routes. The asymmetry in routing was particularly problematic for traffic intended to reach Panorama from the NGFW, as the return traffic defaulted through the VPN, deviating from the desired path.

The configuration issue with the firewall is acknowledged as a known issue. The only mitigation provided is documented in Microsoft&#x27;s official documentation. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/whats-new#known-issues

 

 
Possible solutions:

Exposing the Panorama to the public IP and creating a relay subnet for routing / advertising summary route from NCUS to SCUS for NCUS subnet (10.193.0.0/16)</span>

Historically, data extraction from unstructured documents was a manual and tedious process. It consisted of a combination of constant human involvement or the incorporation of tools that were limited, due to the various document formats, inability to recognize font color and styles, and the document’s data quality being substandard.
 
These methods were time-consuming and often resulted in errors due to the complexities involved in understanding and interpreting unstructured data. The process also lacked scalability, making it difficult to process large volumes of documents efficiently.
 
With the advancements of LLMs, the ability to extract data from unstructured documents has significantly improved and offers users a more adaptable solution based on their indivi…</span>

I am grew up in a small village, but when I was there I remember life was very simple and dreams seemed out of reach. The first tech gift my father gave me was a small dummy phone, when I turned twelve. Sure, it was just a toy, but that simple toy to me set off a curiosity for stuff like this that would persist throughout my life.

 
Growing up, although we all have dreams of what we want to be when we grow older, as I got older and learned more, I knew that I wanted something meaningful- not just for me but to the society where I belong, to the soil which feed me.

                              <span>Generative AI has come a long way in just two years, revolutionizing industries and unlocking new possibilities for developers across the globe. What initially started as a niche field primarily dominated by research and Python-based machine learning has quickly become a mainstream technology that’s reshaping how we approach creativity, automation, and interaction. But what’s even more exciting is how accessible this technology has become for developers from all backgrounds—especially JavaScript developers! :party_popper:
Today, generative AI isn’t just about building complex models in Python. The real magic happens when these models are integrated into applications that users interact with every day, and that’s where JavaScript comes in. As the web’s most widely used programming language,…</span>

Java applications often face startup delays due to their runtime initialization and class loading processes. In the cloud-native era, applications start and stop more frequently, with an increasing need for scale-out to accommodate dynamic traffic demands, making this issue even more prominent. To mitigate this, CRaC (Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint) offers a solution to this challenge by allowing applications to be checkpointed and restored, thus avoiding lengthy startup time after the first initialization. Based on the experiment on the Spring PetClinic project project, we observed a 7x improvement in startup speed after enabling CRaC on Azure Kubernetes Service.

One common method used previously is polling the backend for changes at specific intervals. However, this approach is not ideal as it slows down the client-side application and increases traffic on the backend. One solution to this problem is SignalR.
 
In this blog, we’ll explore how to build a real-time web application using three cutting-edge technologies: SignalR, WebAssembly, and ASP.NET Core API. SignalR simplifies the process of adding real-time web functionality, WebAssembly brings near-native performance to web apps, and ASP.NET Core API provides a robust and scalable backend.

Cost is only one parameter when developing AI solutions though. You need testability, you need mock data, redundancy, etc. In other words, you need all the things you need even if there isn&#x27;t any AI near your app at all. While not front and center on the Azure landing page, Microsoft does have tools and features that can assist you with this and that is what we&#x27;ll look at today.

Note: the focus here is not on the AI bits themselves so that part is not fancy at all. The focus is on the supporting pieces.

                              <span>Introduction
In the age of AI and machine learning, data is the key to training and fine-tuning models. However, gathering high-quality, diverse datasets can be challenging. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution, but how do you ensure the data you&#x27;re creating is both valid and responsible?
This blog will explore the process of crafting responsible synthetic data, evaluating it, and using it for fine-tuning models. We’ll also dive into Azure AI’s RAFT distillation recipe, a novel approach to generating synthetic datasets using Meta’s Llama 3.1 model and UC Berkeley’s Gorilla project.

In today’s fast-paced digital landscape, the need for automatic and scalable solutions for real-time deployment has never been greater. As many organizations rely on virtual machines as an underlying compute layer, implementing an effective observability strategy becomes essential to ensure optimal performance and reliability. With a solid observability framework, businesses can gain critical insights into their infrastructure, enabling them to identify and address issues before they impact service delivery. In other words, it’s important for customers to adopt a more proactive approach rather than a reactive one.

This guide is designed for beginners who want to integrate Azure AI Content Safety into their chatbots. We&#x27;ll build a simple chatbot using JavaScript, React, and Next.js that incorporates Azure&#x27;s text moderation and prompt shields to prevent the generation of harmful content. While we use JavaScript and Next.js for this guide, the concepts discussed within can be applied to other languages, frameworks, and libraries.
 
The repository accompanying this blog can be found here.
 
Prerequisites:

Basic knowledge of JavaScript, React, and Next.js.
An Azure account with access to Azure AI Content Safety and Azure OpenAI services.
Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

In single sign-on systems like SAML and OAUTH, tokens are how services know who you are and what you can do. When you sign in to your machine with your Microsoft Entra ID account, you are getting a session token you can use to access things like your email, teams and other apps. Check out new capabilities like Credential Guard in Windows enforced by device policies in Intune, Token Protection enforcement in Microsoft Entra, and Token theft detections in Microsoft Sentinel and Defender XDR.
 

 
Alex Weinert, from the Microsoft Entra team, explains what tokens are and how token theft works. Then, Jeremy Chapman, Director of Microsoft 365 shows how to defend yourself from these attacks.

Recently, I had the opportunity to explore Windows on ARM (24H2), hosted on an Azure Virtual Machine. Yes, you heard that right—Windows on ARM is available on Azure, and many people aren&#x27;t aware of it! You don’t need a physical Windows Dev Kit 2023 or Windows Copilot+PC to access it.
 
What is Windows on ARM?Windows on ARM refers to the version of the Windows operating system optimized for devices running ARM-based processors, as opposed to traditional x86 architecture. ARM processors are known for their power efficiency, making them ideal for mobile and energy-conscious devices. Over the past few years, ARM has grown in popularity due to its ability to …</span>

                              <span>We are excited to announce a powerful new feature for Azure Load Testing: the ability to set test criteria on server-side metrics. This enhancement allows you to define precise failure conditions based on the performance of your server-side components, providing greater insight into performance bottlenecks and resource throttling issues.
Why Server-Side Metrics Matter
Traditionally, Azure Load Testing has empowered users to define test-failure criteria tailored to client-side metrics. By setting threshold values for these metrics, users could determine when their load test should be considered a failure. However, performance bottlenecks often originate from server-side resource constraints. By allowing test criteria configuration on server-side metrics, we provide a more comprehensive moni…</span>

                              <span>We are excited to share with you that we will be transitioning from Alpine to Debian as the default Linux distribution for WordPress on App Service. While Alpine has served us well with its lightweight and performant nature, our evolving needs require a more feature-rich environment. Debian is the ideal candidate to support our next phase of development and growth. This transition will also align us with App Service Linux, which already utilizes Debian as the default Linux distribution.
For those who might not be familiar, Linux distributions, or Linux distros, are complete operating system packages that include the Linux kernel and a set of pre-installed programs. There are hundreds of distros available; some are commercial, while others are community-developed. Alpine Linux and Debian ar…</span>

                              <span>The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has led to powerful tools for enhancing search and recommendation systems across various domains. This blog post introduces RoomRadar.Ai, an advanced proof-of-concept application developed as part of a UCL MSc Computer Science Industry Exchange Network (IXN) project with Microsoft. RoomRadar.Ai aims to improve the hotel search experience by integrating novel AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), to provide more personalised and contextually relevant results. In this article, we&#x27;ll explore the project&#x27;s technical implementation.

Currently, IT infrastructure stores and maintains data assets, even though IT doesn&#x27;t own or use the data.  
There&#x27;s a disconnect between how data needs to be discovered and maintained within the business, and the teams that maintain it.  
Without standardized procedures for data governance, data handling often relies on manual processes, leading to inefficiencies, data loss, insufficient data protection and higher operational costs. 
Microsoft Purview is designed to help enterprises get the most value from their existing information assets.

                              <span>Scenario
Customers follow the Microsoft doc to create CMK encrypted objects (data source, index etc.), but get the 500 Internal Server Error:
{&#x27;error&#x27;:{&#x27;code&#x27;:&#x27;&#x27;,&#x27;message&#x27;:&#x27;Could not use key vault key to wrap/unwrap the encryption key. {\\&#x27;Message\\&#x27;:\\&#x27;An error has occurred.\\&#x27;}&#x27;}
Possible Causes

The key vault host is incorrect, e.g. incorrect key vault name or domain.

Action: check the keyVaultUri in the Json payload to make sure it is correct.


The key vault host is inaccessible to search. For example, the key vault has public network access disabled but does not have a shared private link (SPL) configured from search. 

Action: check the SPL configurations or create a SPL and make sure it is approved. 



Note that if the key vault Uri is correct or accessible, the error message due to a wrong key vault key name or version in the JSON payload is slightly different. The error message has the complete key vault key path.
{&quot;error&quot;: {&quot;code&quot;: &quot;&quot;,&quot;message&quot;: &quot;Could not use key vault key https://keyvaultname.vault.azure.net:443/keys/wrongkeyname to wrap/unwrap the encryption key. The key vault key cannot be found.&quot;}}</span>

                              <span>When in the developer flow the Azure Developer CLI (azd) can provide a good experience when you want to move the code from your machine to the cloud especially in tandem with .NET Aspire. To be clear - it does require your solution to fit into a select number of categories and does not work for everything you can create in Visual Studio. (.NET Aspire drives you towards Azure Container Apps whereas azd on its own can also do things like Azure App Services so there&#x27;s also the question of whether you want both tools or just the one. But that&#x27;s a bigger topic not in scope for today.)

Route summarization, also known as route aggregation, is a technique used in networking to combine multiple routes into a single, summarized route. This helps reduce the size of routing tables and simplifies the routing process.
 
 
 
Why Use Route Summarization in Azure VMware Solution?
Route summarization for Azure VMware Solution (AVS) is essential in the following scenario:
Route Tables with a 400 UDR Route Limitation: If you need to direct AVS workload segments through a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) like Azure Firewall or a third-party firewall, you must create a User-Defined Route (UDR) for each AVS segment individually. This can quickly become cumbersome if your AVS environment has over 400 segments, as there is a 400 UDR route limitation per Route Ta…</span>

                              <span>Find and control oversharing in SharePoint as you get ready for Microsoft 365 Copilot. With simple practices as a SharePoint site owner or a SharePoint admin using the admin center you can adjust site privacy settings and site memberships, ensuring only authorized members can access sensitive content. Microsoft 365 Copilot respects individual access permissions and in turn what each user can find using search in Microsoft 365, so it&#x27;s important to right-size information access. 
 
Set up test accounts to identify potential oversharing and take corrective actions. By right-sizing permissions you can protect valuable information while also enhancing the relevance of AI-generated responses.

Welcome to this new blog series dedicated to Responsible AI (RAI), covering conceptual overviews, RAI toolchain in the Azure ecosystem and practical examples of its usage!
 
Responsible AI at its core is about developing, deploying and managing AI systems in a way that is ethical, secure, and inclusive. Microsoft&#x27;s commitment to RAI is the result of a long journey of innovation and research, which led us to where we are today, to the point of operationalizing RAI in our products and enabling our customers to do so.
 
To grasp the fundamentals of Microsoft&#x27;s RAI standard and framework, you can start by reading this article, which features a lot of helpful learning resources. 
 

 
Starting by today and every 2 weeks, we are going to publish a blog post focusing on a different aspect or tool enabling developers to innovate responsibly. Such topics include content filtering, evaluations, mitigation strategies, jailbreaks, plus coverage for new responsible AI announcements!

                              <span>Our last roadmap update was in March 2024, in which we outlined the plans for the in-process model for .NET 8. That has since been released, and in this post, we’ll cover what you can expect throughout the rest of 2024.
 
.NET 8 option for the in-process model
Since our last post, we have released support for .NET 8 on the in-process model! Apps already using .NET 6 on the in-process model can move to .NET 8 by following the steps in the updating to target .NET 8 on the in-process model guidance.
 
Please keep in mind that support ends for the in-process model on November 10, 2026, and you’ll want to begin planning your migration to the isolated worker model in advance of that date.
 
.NET 9 (Preview)
The isolated worker model now supports .NET 9 as a Preview on Linux, starting with .NET 9…</span>

Comprehensive documentation is crucial for end users in open-source software projects, but manual creation and maintenance are time-consuming and costly. Traditional documentation generators like Pydoc rely on predefined rules and in-line code information. However, emerging generative AI techniques, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), offer new possibilities for enhanced documentation generation. Developed in partnership with Microsoft and UCL, DocAider aims to create an AI-powered documentation tool that automatically generates and updates code documentation. The tool leverages Github Actions workflows to trigger documentation tasks upon pull requests (PRs) opening, providing valuable insights into continuous documentation maintenance. This approach addresses the c…</span>

                              <span>The rapid evolution of AI has led to powerful tools for knowledge retrieval and question-answering systems, particularly with the rise of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This blog post introduces my capstone project, created as part of the IXN program at UCL in collaboration with Microsoft, aimed at enhancing RAG systems by integrating multimodal knowledge extraction and retrieval capabilities. The system enables AI agents to process both textual and visual data, offering more accurate and contextually relevant responses. In this post, I’ll walk you through the project’s goals, development journey, technical implementation, and outcomes.
 
Project Overview
The main goal of this project was to improve the performance of RAG systems by refining how multimodal data is extracted,…</span>

Google Workspace federation allows you to manage user identities in your Entra ID tenants while authenticating these users through Google. This can be beneficial if your company wants to use a single source of identities across different cloud platforms.
This article covers the scenario where your domain is already added and verified in Entra ID.
 
Requirements
To use Google Workspace federation, you need to ensure that your federated users are created in the Entra ID directory. This can be done through various methods such as auto-provisioning or using the Graph API.
Keep in mind, that the out-of-the box federation for Google only works for gmail.com personal accounts. In order to federate with work accounts managed in Google Workspace, you have …</span>

Natural Language Processing (NLP)  has revolutionized how we interact with technology, enabling us to communicate with machines more human-likely. Language models, a critical component of NLP, have become increasingly sophisticated, allowing us to build applications that can understand, generate, and process human language. However, as language models become more complex, it&#x27;s essential to ensure that they are performing optimally and reliably.
Evaluating language models is a crucial step in achieving this goal. By assessing the performance of language models, we can identify areas of improvement, optimize their performance, and ensure that they are reliable and accurate. However, evaluating language models can be a challenging task, requiring significant expertise and resourc…</span>

                              <span>Azure Container Apps is a fully managed, serverless container platform that enables you to build, deploy, and run containerized applications. With Azure Container Apps, you can elastically scale down to 0 and expand as needed. You can design resilient microservices with unified networking and leverage GPU-enabled workload profiles to run AI-powered apps anytime anywhere. All of this means your developer gets to spend a lot more time writing code for your business and not get sidetracked by things that don’t directly contribute to your success. To take things to the next level, we’ve created a wide range of productivity experiences to help you configure, monitor and troubleshoot Java apps, which are now generally available.

                              <span>We’re thrilled to share with you that WordPress on App Service now supports Managed Identity. This means your WordPress site can securely access other Azure resources, like Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server and Azure Communication Service Email, without the hassle of managing connection strings and secrets.
 
What is a managed Identity and why should you implement it for WordPress on App Service?
A frequent issue developers face is handling secrets, credentials, certificates, and keys needed for secure communication between services. Managed identities remove the necessity for developers to oversee these credentials.
Even though developers can securely store secrets in Azure Key Vault, services still require a method to access it. Managed identities offer an automatically managed id…</span>

                              <span>As cloud engineers and architects embrace containerization, ensuring secure communication becomes paramount. Data transmission and access control are critical aspects of security that need to be considered. SSH tunneling is a technique that can help achieve secure communication between different components of an application or solution. SSH tunneling creates an encrypted channel over an existing SSH connection, allowing secure data transmission between a local machine (SSH client) and a remote server (SSH server).
In this article, we will show how to set up SSH tunneling between containers running in the cloud that need to communicate with downstream resources via an SSH server hosted in a cloud VM.

In this blog post, I will demonstrate how to leverage Azure API Management to enhance the resiliency and capacity of your OpenAI Service.Azure API Management is a tool that assists in creating, publishing, managing, and securing APIs. It offers features like routing, caching, throttling, authentication, transformation, and more.By utilizing Azure API Management, you can:

Distribute requests across multiple instances of the Azure OpenAI Service using the priority-based load balancing technique, which includes groups with weight distribution inside the group. This helps spread the load across various resources and regions, thereby enhancing the availability and performance of your service.

                              <span>Introduction:
 
In this post, I explore a recent experiment aimed at creating a RAG pipeline tailored for the insurance industry, specifically for handling automobile insurance claims, with the goal of potentially reducing processing times.
 
I also showcase the implementation of Autogen AI Agents to enhance search retrieval through agent interaction and function calls on sample auto insurance claims documents, a Q&amp;A use case, and how this workflow can substantially reduce the time required for claims processing.
 
RAG workflows in my opinion represent a novel data stack, distinct from traditional ETL processes. Although they encompass data ingestion and processing similar to traditional ETL in data engineering, they introduce additional pipeline stages like chunking, embedding, and the lo…</span>
