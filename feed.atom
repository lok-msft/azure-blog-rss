        <link href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/how-to-detect-java-dependency-version-conflict-using-idea-maven/ba-p/3915091"/>
        <updated>2023-09-01T01:34:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Java dependency version conflict occurs when two or more dependencies in your project have incompatible versions of the same class or resource. This can cause runtime errors, unexpected behavior, or compilation failures in your Java application. Sometimes it is hard to detect them, while with the help of IDEA Maven Helper, it has never been so simple.
 
1. Install the plugin
In IntelliJ IDEA, choose File -> Settings -> Plugins. Within the Marketplace tab, search for Maven Helper and click Install.

 
2. Leverage the plugin
Open the pom.xml file of your project and switch to the Dependency Analyzer tab at the bottom.

You will see three options: Conflicts, All Dependencies as List, and All Dependencies as Tree. Choose Conflicts to see if there are any dependency conflicts in your project.

 
3. Resolve conflict
To resolve a conflict, you can right-click on a dependency on the left panel and choose Exclude. This will add an exclusion tag to your pom.xml file and remove the dependency from your project. Alternatively, you can also choose a compatible version of the dependency that works with all other dependencies and declare it explicitly in your pom.xml file using the dependencyManagement section.
After resolving a conflict, you can refresh the Dependency Analyzer tab to see if there are any remaining conflicts. You can also use the All Dependencies as List or All Dependencies as Tree options to see all the dependencies in your project in different formats.

 
4. Conclusion
Dependency conflicts can be difficult to detect, but they can cause a lot of problems in the project. By using the above-mentioned technique and following best practices to prevent dependency conflicts, you can ensure your application runs smoothly without any issues.

APIs often return a large amount of data. Pagination allows you to retrieve a manageable subset of this data at a time, preventing unnecessary strain on resources and reducing the likelihood of timeouts or errors.
In this example, the client starts by requesting the first page of data from the server. The server responds with both the data and metadata indicating the current page, the total number of records. The client then proceeds to request subsequent pages of data until it reaches the last page. This approach allows for efficient data retrieval and processing without overwhelming the client or the server.

Ensure the URL is formed correctly as per the operation you are trying to perform.
The header needs to be passed and can be done using “-H” parameter.
Ensure you are appending/removing extra ‘?’ to the SAS token in the URLs accordingly.

Background: Tabular models are structured as BIM files containing various elements like data sources, measures, relationships, dimensions, queries, and roles in a nested JSON format.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Plotting "unique users" charts from API Management logs
It is quite a common requirement when working with API gateways (such as Azure API Management) to understand how many users are actively accessing your applications in the backend. However, the solution for that is not the same for everyone. For instance, a metric exposed out-of-the-box is the total number of HTTP requests... but that doesn't tell us how many unique users we have. Normally, an application running in the client devices generates multiple HTTP requests towards the backend.
So... How can we get the number of active and unique users from Azure API Management data?

Scaling out Socket.IO apps can be frustrating for developers.
Overwhelmingly, users reported their love of the “intuitive APIs” and how easy it is to get productive with the library once they get over the initial learning curve.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We can follow the below steps to remove the PHP X-Powered-By header from HTTP response for PHP 8.x apps on Linux App Service –
By default, PHP version is getting displayed as in the below screenshot-

 
 Updating PHP Settings-

Go to your KUDU site https://<sitename>.scm.azurewebsites.net.
Select Bash or SSH from the top menu.
In Bash/SSH, go to your "/home/site" directory.
Create a directory called "ini" (i.e. mkdir ini)
Change directories to "ini".
We'll need to create an "ini" file to add our settings to.  In this example, I'm using "settings.ini".  There are no file editors such as Vi, Vim, or Nano so we'll simply use echo to add the settings to the file.  I'm changing the expose_php setting to Off.  Below is the command that I used to add the setting and create an "settings.ini" file if one doesn't already exist.

 NOTE:  If you already have an extensions.ini file, you can use the same command which will add the new setting to the file. 
/home/site/ini>echo " expose_php = Off " >> settings.ini
If using SSH, you can use vi to create/edit the settings file using the following commands.

 vi settings.ini
 Press "i" on your keyboard to start editing and add the following.

 expose_php = Off  
3. Press "Esc", then ":wq!" and enter to save.
Add an Application Setting-
We'll now need to go to the Azure Portal and add an Application Setting to scan the "ini" directory
              1) Go to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com) and select your App Service Linux PHP application.
              2) Select Application Settings for the app.
              3) Under the Application settings section, press the "+ Add new setting".
              4) For the App Setting Name, enter "PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR". For the value, enter "/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d:/home/site/ini"
 
Testing – 
Go to kudu site and run the command below and you can verify that PHP header is removed.
CURL -I <site url pointing to a PHP script>]]></summary>

Azure OpenAI Pricing Overview
To give everyone a bit of a context, the pricing for Azure OpenAI Service is based on a pay-as-you-go consumption model, which means you only pay for what you use. The price per unit depends on the type and size of the model you choose. It also depends upon the number of tokens being used in the prompt and the response.

The Access Control Lists (ACLs) of your Azure Storage Account assume a pivotal role in establishing permissions for both containers and blobs situated within the storage account. The inheritance of ACLs is already in place for newly generated child items beneath a parent directory. However, it's noteworthy that now you also have the capability to set, update, or remove ACLs recursively for the pre-existing child items of a parent directory, thereby eliminating the need to undertake these operations for each individual child item.

A global enterprise wants to migrate thousands of VMware vSphere virtual machines (VMs) to Microsoft Azure as part of their application modernization strategy. The first step is to exit their on-premises data centers and rapidly relocate their legacy application VMs to the Azure VMware Solution as a staging area for the first phase of their modernization strategy. What should the Azure VMware Solution look like?

Recently, I have touched on a case when the customer would like to interact with Azure PowerShell Function to work with Storage Account and SFTP server. There are some advantages why customers would like to apply for this solution:

PowerShell allows IT admins to apply system-level integration with other components more easily.
Azure Functions provide the convenience of URI/timer-triggered maintenance tasks.

Demand Analysis
We will first start with the demand analysis. The task will be divided into the following sections:

Pull the required file contents from Azure Storage Account, and store them inside Azure Function App.
Upload files to another VM via SFTP.
To work with Azure resources, we also need to apply proper authentication to enhance security.

Visual Studio utilizes many caches to increase the performance of key features like Find in Files and IntelliSense. When opening a solution for the first time these caches must be generated by indexing and processing the codebase. Working with large solutions can add a significant amount of time to startup while these caches are created. Once the caches are created Visual Studio can quickly use these features.

This guide is to help you troubleshoot Azure SQL connectivity and authentication issues on Linux App Services.
Note: At the time of writing this cannot be executed in Linux Function Apps, since we don't have access to the environmental variables needed to run the commands. 
On Windows App Services you can performance such connectivity and authentication troubleshooting by running MSI Validator, but on Linux App Services we need to leverage the WebSSH functionality to troubleshoot.
So, to address below you can find a list of commands to test connectivity and access to Azure SQL Server Database on Linux App Services. 
Connectivity troubleshooting steps
We would need to follow the 4 steps mentioned below to test the connectivity:

In case of a disconnection, you might run into common errors such as "Azure Functions runtime is unreachable". Fortunately, Microsoft has a helpful guide to address this issue, which provides self-help troubleshooting steps for recovering your storage account in case of such errors.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) supports integration of KEDA with your AKS cluster to scale your workloads based on Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus metrics from your Azure Monitor workspace.
 
Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus (also known as Managed Prometheus in Azure) is a fully managed Prometheus service in Azure (it includes a fully managed data store, query service, ruler service, Prometheus compatible query APIs, and managed add-on for data collection from, ARC-connected on-prem or other cloud Kubernetes offerings). As a first step, this service is fully integrated with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as an add-on which scrapes Prometheus metrics.
 
To integrate KEDA into your Azure Kubernetes Service, you will need to deploy and configure a workload identity or pod identity on your cluster. This identity allows KEDA to authenticate with Azure and retrieve metrics for scaling from your Monitor workspace.
 
We recommend using Azure Active Directory workload identity. This authentication method replaces pod-managed identity (pod-managed identity in AKS has been deprecated as of 10/24/2022), which integrates with the Kubernetes native capabilities to federate with any external identity providers on behalf of the application.
 
Azure Managed Prometheus support starts from KEDA v2.10. If you have an older version of KEDA installed, you must upgrade in order to work with Azure Managed Prometheus.
 
To integrate KEDA into your AKS, please start with our documentation, and reach out to us should you have any feedback or questions!]]></summary>

I. What is Epoch?
Epoch is a unique identifier (epoch value) that the service uses, to enforce partition/lease ownership. Thus, epoch features allow one consumer to have exclusive access to a partition despite the competition from other consumers from the same consumer group to use that same partition. This protocol is used from the Event Processor Host (EPH) SDK by using CreateEpochReceiver method. For more information, please visit the following link.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Q1: What are cipher suites and how do they work on App Service?

A cipher suite is a set of instructions that contains algorithms and protocols to help secure network connections between clients and servers. By default, the front-end’s OS would pick the most secure cipher suite that is supported by both the front-end and the client. However, if the client only supports weak cipher suites, then the front-end’s OS would pick a weak cipher suite that they both support.
App Service does SSL termination on the Frontend layer, which happens before the frontend instances forward requests to workers.

Introduction
As an educator, grading tests and assignments is a challenging and time-consuming task. The process involves several steps, such as collecting all completed scripts, reviewing the standard answers and marking for each question, assigning marks, and repeating the process for each student. Once all questions have been marked, the total score for each student must be calculated and entered into a spreadsheet. Finally, the scored scripts are returned to the students.

        <updated>2023-07-24T07:26:58.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are multiple ways to increase the concurrency of python function app. I drew an architecture diagram, which can give us an overall understanding of the function app.
 

Based on the diagram, we can see we could increase function app concurrency by increasing instance count, python worker count and thread count. To better understand this, I build several labs to validate this. I will not demonstrate instance count as it is easy to understand. All these labs are having 4 concurrent incoming requests and each request takes 10 seconds to complete.
 
Lab1:
code:
sync

Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=1
Result:
It took 40 seconds to complete the 4 executions. We can see these 4 executions were triggered at the same time, this is because the function host level is using async. But actually these executions are executed one by one.

Lab2:
code: The same as Lab1.
Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=2
Result:
It took 20 seconds to complete the 4 executions.

 
Lab3:
code: The same as Lab1.
Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=2PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=2
Result:
It took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.

Lab4:
code:
async

Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=1
Result:
It took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.

 
Conclusion:
1.We can increase the concurrency by increasing FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT and PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT. Just note that we can configure the concurrent setting in host.json file. This is the bottleneck of the concurrency. 
2.It is more recommended to use async method instead of sync method as async has better performance than sync with the same configuration.

As a container app revision scales out, new instances of the revision are created on-demand. These instances are known as replicas.
Adding or editing scaling rules creates a new revision of your container app. A revision is an immutable snapshot of your container app. 
 
Scaling is driven by different categories of triggers - this blog discusses HTTP and Custom triggers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a PHP developer, sometimes you might want to set the custom configuration file (.ini) to read when PHP starts up. For this article, I would like demonstrate how to load custom configuration file (.ini) in the Azure App Service.
 
By default, we set the PHP_INI_DIR = /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d, so when using SSH on Kudu, you could see there are lots of .ini files:

 
Based on this, you might think we could just manually add our custom .ini files in /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d, but it will not work after restart. Since only "/home" data will be persistent after restarting App Service. So what we need to do is to add our .ini in "/home", E.g. "/home/site/ini"
 
For example, if I would like to modify "upload_max_filesize to 64M (defualt is 2M) and post_max_size to 64M (default is 8M)" for the PHP website, I could follow the below steps to achieve it:
 
Step 1:
Use like vi/vim command to add setting.ini file in the "/home/site/ini" folder

 
Step 2:
PHP supports scanning multiple directories for .ini files. For this we need to set PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR with ":" to separate values on the Application Setting for the target App Service.
E.g. PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR = :/home/site/ini
This ensures that we load *.ini files from  /usr/local/etc/php and then load from /home/site/ini

 
 
After, we check the value by simple php page and it will show upload_max_size and post_max_size are set as 64M now.

Why send Syslog data to Sentinel 
Syslog data can help you monitor security and health of your AKS workloads. By sending Syslog data to Sentinel, you can use its cloud native SIEM features to detect and respond to threats, investigate incidents, and create dashboards and reports for your Kubernetes workloads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overview
  The SSV2 feature starts or stops Azure Virtual Machines instances across multiple subscriptions. It starts or stops virtual machines on user-defined   schedules, provides insights through Azure Application Insights, and sends optional notifications by using action groups.
  Azure offers an ARM template for deployment. So, you can easily deploy SSV2 using GitHub.
  For more detail, please see the SSV2 docs.
 
Purpose of SSV2
 The main purpose of using SSV2 is to save costs. By using Scheduled SSV2, we can turn on the VM only during business hours (ex. 9AM-6PM) and shut it down the rest of the time. Also, we can set the VM to automatically shut down when not in use by the Auto Stop function.In this post, I focus on how much we can save VM resource costs using SSV2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Static Web App offers two types of preview environments: branch environment and named environment. Both of these methods offer isolated environments for testing and deploying changes to your Azure Static Web App, allowing you to test and validate changes without affecting the main production environment.
 
Here are the steps to create a preview environment:
 
1. After deploying the production branch to the main site, create a new branch based on the main branch and name it "dev".


 
2. Modify your YAML file in the dev branch to include "dev" in the trigger to track any changes in the dev branch.

 
3. Set "production_branch" to the name of your production branch. This action will ensure the deploy task in the dev branch creates a new preview environment.

 
4. Save the changes and after deployment, you can see a new environment named 'dev' for the dev branch.

 
5. If you want to name a preview environment separately (instead of using the branch name), set the "deployment_environment" to the desired name, and it will create a named environment.

 

 
The main difference between branch and named environments is that branch environments are created automatically based on the branch name, whereas named environments are custom-named. 
 
Overall, both branch and named environments provide isolated environments for testing and deploying changes to your Azure Static Web App, allowing you to test and validate changes without affecting the main production environment. The choice of environment type typically depends on the specific needs and development process of your project.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Encrypting data at rest is a primary step in securing a Kubernetes cluster. KMS provides an interface for a provider to utilize a key stored in an external key service to perform this encryption. While KMS v1 on AKS enabled the encryption of Kubernetes secrets using a key in Azure Key Vault, it was limited to only supporting encryption of 2000 secrets. To address this limitation, the Azure Container Upstream team, in collaboration with the Kubernetes community, spearheaded the enhancement project. After being part of two Kubernetes releases, this feature has graduated to beta in Kubernetes v1.27. As soon as KMS v2 became beta in v1.27, Microsoft promptly made it available on AKS as one of many security enhancement features available to its users. For a full list of KMSv2 enhancements, check out this Kubernetes blog post.
For clusters at version v1.27+ with KMS newly enabled, KMS v2 is configured by default. However, for clusters with KMS enabled at versions below v1.27, upgrading to v1.27 will be blocked . To upgrade, follow the steps outlined in this documentation for migrating from KMS v1 to v2, and then proceed with upgrading the cluster to version v1.27. Running your v1.27 AKS cluster with KMS v2 feature enabled, you can now encrypt more than 2000 secrets.]]></summary>

The loading is due to the container starting (Alpine Linux and NodeJS). Cold Starts are not really a thing for workloads under regular load.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overview:
We can secure a custom DNS name with the help of TLS/SSL binding in Azure App Service.
 
When hosting a website on Azure App Service, it is important to ensure that the site is secure and can be accessed via a custom domain name. This can be achieved by using TLS/SSL binding, which encrypts data transmitted to and from the website, thereby ensuring that sensitive information is protected. With this setup, users can access the website via a custom domain name, which adds an extra layer of professionalism and branding to the site.
 
Issue:
The users are not able to purchase and bind the app service certificate for their app service having a custom domain with a special character from Azure Portal.
 
Solution and recommendations:

Azure by default does not provide the facility to purchase the custom domain with the special character except periods and dashes.

 


The user can purchase the custom domain outside Azure with special characters apart from periods and dashes.
In this case, the user will not be able to purchase the App Service Certificate from Azure with the custom domain consists a special character.
To purchase and bind the Certificate with such domain from Azure Portal, the custom domain first needs to be converted to its Punny code using the below converter:

 
Punycode converter (IDN converter), Punycode to Unicode :wrench:(punycoder.com)

 

Purchase the certificate with the Punny code custom domain and bind the certificate with the app service custom domain.

Add and manage TLS/SSL certificates - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn
 

Browse the app service to verify the SSL Certificate.


 
If this helps you, do let me know via like and comments section, cheers!
Happy Learning!

Have you ever built a machine learning model and asked yourself what is the next step? Bingo, Deploying the machine learning model to the internet to be able to use it anywhere you want. Sometimes, you struggle with this process and may find yourself asking the following questions:
What are the accepted formats for my model?
How can I do it?
What are the things that I need in order to deploy my model?
 
In this blog, we will go through a step-by-step coding guide, from converting our model to ONNX format until we use it in our Power Apps application.
 
Technical Architecture
We will start by creating a resource group inside the Azure Platform and then creating an Azure Machine Learning Workspace, Compute, and Notebook. Inside the notebook, we will run some code that will help us t…]]></summary>

Azure Event Hubs is a big data streaming platform that collects events from multiple sources to be ingested by Azure and external services.  
The new ability to ingest data can be powerful for customers who already use message queueing mechanisms and are interested in ingesting data into a Log Analytics or Sentinel workspace, or ingesting into multiple destinations.
Customers who use Kafka can connect their applications to a Kafka endpoint on an event hub without any code changes.
 
The main benefits of this feature are:

Highly scalable and reliable ingestion - start ingest megabytes of data and grow to gigabytes or terabytes.
Fully managed service that doesn’t require use and maintenance of other components like functions, Logic Apps, and plugins to ingest data from Event Hubs into a Log Analytics workspace.
Requires minimum configuration with flexibility to add more advanced configurations using transformations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a web technology designed to enable servers to transmit data to clients without the need for client-initiated requests. SSE proves to be highly advantageous for applications requiring real-time updates, such as chat platforms, news feeds, or stock price trackers. Traditionally, these applications would involve clients repeatedly requesting data from servers at predefined intervals.
 
This blog post delves into the configuration process of setting up a server-sent events (SSE) API within Azure API Management (APIM). APIM is a comprehensive service offering the creation, publication, management, and security of APIs. APIM facilitates SSE APIs by applying a specialized policy that enables the seamless transmission of streaming responses.

Have you ever walked into a store, did some shopping, and headed back home only to find that you forgot to buy 60% of the items you needed to get?
I struggle with this very same issue and so I decided to create the ‘Smart Shopping Planner’, an application that will help me keep track of the items I need to buy and that I can easily update before and after shopping.
 
Smart Shopping Planner is a React application built using JavaScript, that stores data in an Azure SQL database. In this blog, I want to show you how incredibly easy it was to provide REST endpoints (you can work with GraphQL too) to connect the app to the database.

Federated credentials / workload identity federation allows your CI/CD pipelines in GitHub and GitLab to access your Azure subscription without any secrets stored in the pipeline config.
GitHub's azure/login@1 task handles this transparently, but I also explain how it works under the hood. GitLab supplies the necessary token directly to your pipeline run.
Both GitHub and GitLab are easy to setup and federate securely with your Azure subscription.
BitBucket can't be setup that way, because tokens issued by BitBucket don't have a predicable subject identifier.

Overview
This article demonstrates how to configure, and securely access, an Azure environment from within a GitHub and a GitLab CI/CD pipeline, without having to store credentials on the GitHub/GitLab side. The article also br…]]></summary>

In a previous blog, I asked the concluding question:


How will industry and jobs change in the co-pilot first world(where humans and AI work together and AI is the co-pilot)? 
What will that mean to pedagogy and evaluation?

In this blog, I explain how such a framework could be implemented through the use of prompt engineering for GPT to create a reflective, deeper format for learning. We are exploring some of these ideas in our AI courses at the University of Oxford, however all views expressed here are solely my own. We are also developing these ideas as a platform for our edtech start-up with Pinckney Benedict (Salooki).

Why would you go through the hassle of a complete migration project if you end up with something just as inflexible, as monolithic, and as intrinsically inconvenient as the platform you’re moving away from? 
 
You don’t want your critical mainframe applications to simply run on a somewhat cheaper box either: you want to take advantage of the newest cloud-native technologies that are now available to you, technologies that allows for more flexibility, more scalability, and more evolutions of your applicative landscape.

Introduction 
 
Recently I am having an increasing number of conversations with customers on how best to manage container images in disconnected or highly restricted environments. Cluster security is becoming increasingly more important, a 2023 report by Red Hat showed that 90% of enterprises surveyed had experienced a security incident in their Kubernetes environments in the last 12 months.
 
There is certainly a trend from customers recently to harden environments making the most of Azure Services such as Azure Firewall to manage egress traffic or Network security groups to restrict traffic within an Azure Subscription. When doing this a problem arises regarding how to manage public container images that may b…]]></summary>

Grounding is the process of using large language models (LLMs) with information that is use-case specific, relevant, and not available as part of the LLM's trained knowledge. It is crucial for ensuring the quality, accuracy, and relevance of the generated output. While LLMs come with a vast amount of knowledge already, this knowledge is limited and not tailored to specific use-cases. To obtain accurate and relevant output, we must provide LLMs with the necessary information. In other words, we need to "ground" the models in the context of our specific use-case.
 
Motivation for Grounding
The primary motivation for grounding is that LLMs are not databases, even if they possess a wealth of knowledge. They are designed to be used as general reasoning and text engines. LLMs …]]></summary>

A common problem encountered when having Azure App Service behind Azure Application Gateway is
whether we can use the cookie-based affinity feature on Azure Application Gateway end instead to maintain session stickiness.
 

 
Answer is NO. Because as explained at Azure - Inside the Azure App Service Architecture | Microsoft Learn Azure App Service is distributed system 
and has its own frontend workers and backend workers, 
enabling cookie-based affinity on Application Gateway side only allows requests from the same end user to 
get routed to the same App Service frontend workers within a session

Introduction
Document databases gained huge popularity in the past decade.

When a Function App is added as an API in APIM, there are some authorization details we need to consider while communicating from APIM to the backend function app.
It does not matter what Authorization level (function or anonymous) the function app has configured, APIM will always attach a function host key to the request. The host key is attached to the request as a header. However, we may experiment unauthorized errors even though the function host key is present in the request header.
So, this article is focused on analyzing one of those scenarios when communication between APIM and backend function app is truncated due to unauthorized errors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction and Purpose: 
 
Existing example reference architectures to implement network connectivity between Azure and Azure VMware Solutions (AVS) recommend the use of ExpressRoute Global Reach where available. However, there are also scenarios where either Global Reach is not available (such as Brazil South), or customers simply might have different requirements and need an alternate solution that substitutes Global Reach entirely.   
 
Generally speaking, one viable solution is to implement a public Site-to-Site VPN with Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) while enabling transit capabilities between an ExpressRoute Gateway and a VPN gateway. The goal here is to advertise AVS or other non-overlapping IP address spaces dynamically via BGP. This is commonly referred to as Overlay. For a Hub a…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome back to Armchair Architects as part of the Azure Enablement Show. We will be discussing the role of curiosity in being an Architect. Our hosts will be David Blank-Edelman and our armchair architects Uli Homann and Eric Charran.
 
Eric suggests that there is a direct link between curiosity and humility.
 
From Eric’s point of view, he thinks that there is a direct link between curiosity and humility. Humility is an important ingredient and certainly collaboration across different groups is too, but especially in the architecture discipline. Because in the architecture discipline, there's no other discipline that he can think of in which you go from thinking that you know a lot, and you do know a lot, to the next day being “I've never heard of that and now let me learn about it.” If …]]></summary>

This post shares how I use Azure SQL Database templates, ChatGTP, and the .NET package Bogus to create data safe to be used, random, but that fits the demo theme and requirement.
 
 Don't miss this awesome demo! Watch Leon's session: Full stack scale with the Microsoft Power Platform on the Microsoft Build website.

The Context
Leon needs some sales data for his demo: salespeople, and a history of transactions that cover a year. The data need to be random but fit the demo theme and requirement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce Code-to-Cloud (preview), one of the fastest and easiest way to deploy and manage your web apps on Azure. Code-to-Cloud is a portal-based experience that takes an app-first approach to building, deploying, and running your apps. Code-to-Cloud makes it easier for developers to get started using Azure, without needing to be an expert on the hundreds of different cloud services. 
 
Detect the right Azure services from your repository
 

 
Code-to-Cloud lets you connect your GitHub repositories to Azure, and through analysis of the code inside your GitHub repository, suggests the correct Azure services you should use. Once you deploy, GitHub Actions is used to create a continuous deployment pipeline between your repositories and your newly provisioned cloud services. Once you've deployed your app via Code-to-Cloud, changes to your code will immediately be pushed to your connected Azure services. 
 
Bring your own repository or start from a template
 

 
Code-to-Cloud also provides sample templates, powered by Azure Developer CLI, that provide a helpful blueprint for getting started with Azure. You can use these templates to immediately create a GitHub repository, connect it to Azure, and provision a distinct set of services for the template scenario. Our templates include sample static websites, web apps, and APIs, in a variety of different languages.
 
Manage your app in a consolidated view
 

 
 
In addition to making it easier and faster to get started developing, Code-to-Cloud also provides a simplified, app-centric management experience. A "Space" is a loose collection of cloud services that, collectively, comprise the app you are building. You can manage your compute, database, caching, and other key services all within the same, easy-to-use management experience.
 
To get started immediately, you can check out Code-to-Cloud here. You can also read our documentation to get a better look at what Code-to-Cloud can do for you.]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-05-23T16:36:18.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using Event Hubs capture feature, you can load real-time streaming data to data lakes, warehouses, and other storage services, so that they can be processed or analyzed by analytics services.
We're thrilled to announce the General Availability of Managed Identity support for capturing event streams in Azure Event Hubs.
 
Managed Identities when capturing event streams.
With managed identity, users can seamlessly capture data to a preferred destination by using Azure Active Directory based authentication and authorization. You can use system-assigned or user-assigned managed identities with Event Hubs capturing destinations.
Managed identities provide an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure AD authentication. Applications can use managed identities to obtain Azure AD tokens without having to manage any credentials.

 
In the context of Event Hubs capture feature, these manage identities are used to authenticate and authorize the event capturing agent with the capture destinations such as Azure Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen1 or Gen2.
When configuring event capturing for a given event hub/Kafka topic, users can enable capture and select system assigned or user assigned identity as the authentication mode.

 
Event Hubs Capture feature also supports capturing data to a capture destination in a different subscription with the use of managed identity.
 
Next steps
In conclusion, the introduction of managed identity support for event stream capturing in Event Hubs marks a significant expansion of our event streaming and storing capabilities. Now you can experience the power of secure stream capture and unleash the full potential of your event-driven architecture with Event Hubs.

        <updated>2023-05-23T15:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dev tunnels are a powerful tool to securely open your localhost to the internet and control who has access, so you can easily test and debug your web apps and webhooks from virtually anywhere. With dev tunnels, you can also share your local work in-progress with colleagues or clients to get feedback asynchronously without the hassle of deploying. Previously, the only way you could use dev tunnels was through Visual Studio 2022.
 
Today, we are thrilled to announce the public preview of the devtunnel CLI! To create, host, and connect to your first dev tunnel in seconds, please follow the documentation on Microsoft Learn.
 

 
Use cases
Here are some of the scenarios that dev tunnels enable with the devtunnel CLI or dev tunnels in Visual Studio 2022.

Test an app with external services. For instance, test and debug Power Platform connectors, Azure Communication Services APIs, or Twilio webhooks.
Test and debug a web app on other devices, like mobile phones and tablets.
Make an app temporarily available to others to review your work in progress on a web app or API.

Benefits

Secure by default – Each dev tunnel you create is only accessible to you using your Microsoft, Microsoft Azure Active Directory or GitHub account.
Persistent URLs - Retain the same tunnel URL for extended periods of time.
Support for multiple simultaneous ports - Host multiple ports on a single tunnel at the same time.
Global service availability - The dev tunnels service is available globally. Tunnels are automatically created in the closest available region to ensure optimal performance.
Tunnel inspection - Inspect tunnel traffic in a familiar interface, browser DevTools, to monitor and manage your web apps or webhooks.

To improve the devtunnel CLI, we encourage you to connect with us through GitHub issues to request a feature or submit a bug. We look forward to hearing your feedback!]]></summary>

As with every article in this series this has been driven by customer use cases. In this instance the customer desired having a development web application on a public domain but ring fenced to only allow access to authenticated users from Azure AD.
 
Before we dive deeper into the use case and implementation its important to understand the various components if unfamiliar. I will speak about benefits of certain technologies as I go through but it is worth taking a quick look at these links as a level set if you need it:

I have decided to create a series of blogs covering some of the common ways to increase cluster security.

In this article you will learn how to perform a manual failover to restore service as part of the task to identify the root cause of the problem even though the server is unresponsive.
 
A working example: One potential cause of an unresponsive Azure SQL database is a query that is fired by an API and consumes 100% of the CPU. In this scenario, it can be difficult to identify the problematic query without connection which allows you to query the data management views (DMVs) and pinpoint the problematic query. Once identified, you can disable the API until a fix is implemented.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome back to Armchair Architects as part of the Azure Enablement Show. Today we will be discussing the term concentration risk, which means concentrating your solution on one technology and how to avoid what one architect terms ‘silly miracles’. Our hosts will be David Blank-Edelman and our armchair architects Uli Homann and Eric Charran.
 
Eric defines concentration risk and gives an example.
 
Eric has friends in the financial services industry and the term concentration risk to them means over indexing or over investment in a specific area to the harm of the larger portfolio. The term concentration risk is gaining traction in the technology space also, specifically the architecture space because the same dangers of safeguarding your investment also exist.

It can be a tedious and repetitive process… right?
Not only do you have to redo testing after every minor change, but you also have to repeat it for each environment you deploy to.
What if there was a way to automate the process with minimal coding?
 
First, what exactly is Azure API Management (APIM), if you have not used it before? It's a fully managed service provided by Microsoft Azure that enables you to publish, secure, and manage APIs for your organization. By acting as a gateway between your backend services and the clients that consume them, APIM provides a centralized point of control for your API ecosystem.

In Part 1 and 2 of the series, we showed the basics of how to build an inventory tracking app from scratch incorporating AI-driven Copilot capabilities. We added a mechanical parts table for data entry and sample data stored in Dataverse on the backend.

Mais de quoi s'agit-il exactement et comment cette vidéo pourrait-elle vous aider? 
 
Apprenons .NET - Azure ce partage en deux parties. 
 
La première est une introduction au concept de base du cloud. Pour ce faire nous avons utilisé les trois modules du chemin d'apprentissage: Principes de base de Microsoft Azure: description des concepts du cloud.

Décrire le cloud computing
Décrire les avantages de l’utilisation des services cloud
Décrire les types de services cloud

En plus du contentue de ces modules, nous avons aussi partagé notre expérience provenant de cas réels.  Ce parcours d’apprentissage vous aide à vous préparer pour l'Examen AZ-900: Principes de base Microsoft Azure.
 
La deuxième partie est une introduction l'utilisation de .NET avec Azure. Nous avons construit un site web que nous avons déployé sur Azure en suivant les étoupes du module.

Publier une application web sur Azure avec Visual Studio

En bonus, Laurent nous a montré comment utiliser GitHub Action pour déployer en mode DevOps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re excited to let you know that Azure Monitor – Container Insights now supports multiline logging! With this feature enabled, previously split container logs are stitched together and sent as single entries to the ContainerLogV2 table. Customers are able see container log lines up to 64 KB (up from the existing 16 KB limit). If the stitched log line is larger than 64 KB, it gets truncated due to Log Analytics limits. This feature enables the customers to directly consume the logs in meaningful ways without having to spend time stitching them with custom Kusto queries. Additionally, the feature also adds support for .NET and Go stack traces, which appear as single entries instead of being split into multiple entries in ContainerLogV2 table.
 
Why this is important:
Logs are an essential part of monitoring and troubleshooting applications running in containers. However, when logs are split across multiple lines, it can be challenging to consume them effectively. View the example of Multi-Line below:
 
Multi-Line Disabled

 
Multi-Line Enabled

 
 
To enable multi-line logging:
1. Make sure agent is updated to version 3.1.6 or later
2. Customers must enable ContainerLogV2 for multi-line logging to work. Go to the ConfigMap to enable ContainerLogV2 in Container Insights.

3. Set enable_multiline_logs flag to “true” in the config map.

4. Apply the ConfigMap:
kubectl apply -f container-azm-ms-agentconfig.yaml
 
Next steps for multi-line logging:

Difference between AAD and AAD B2C
AAD (AAD B2B) enables SaaS providers to extend their software to external users without the need to manage separate identity stores for their customers. By using AAD SaaS providers can define roles and scopes for their applications, without having access to AAD instances of the customers where the end users reside. In this…]]></summary>

Achieving high availability is crucial for businesses that rely on their SQL Server databases. With SQL Server on Azure virtual machines, there are two popular deployment architectures to consider: SQL Server Always-On Availability Groups (AG) and SQL Server Always-On Failover Clustering (FCI). However, choosing the right solution for your specific scenario requires careful consideration of various factors. In this article, we will provide a comprehensive guide to help you decide which approach to use, especially when deployed in the Azure environment.

Introduction
Why waste time grading assignments manually when AI can do it in seconds? 
It’s impossible to stop students from using AI tools to answer their assignments, and it’s nonsensical to ask them to do something that AI can complete in a second. The key is to ensure that students are working on their assignments on their own and not copying from others, then using AI to rephrase the language. In fact, it’s nonsensical for teachers to score student work manually when all student…]]></summary>

The fundamental model for Network Connectivity in Azure is Hub and Spoke. As compared to Azure Virtual WAN, the end user has more granular control of the routing and the ability to deploy shared resources on the Hub to be consumed by the Virtual Network (VNet) peers attached to it (Spokes). However, the existing official documentation to attain a Multi Hub and Spoke topology refers to models that include dynamic routing in the Hub using Azure Route Server and Network Virtual Appliances (NVA) which requires a level of complexity as a Network Administrator including the use of protocols like Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and Virtual extensible Local Area Network (VxLAN).

Having the ability to identify clear root cause for incidents in production workloads is valuable, the best way to prevent future incidents is to understand what caused past ones. Of course you can have a good set of load tests but still, incidents in production environments can happen and it's crucial to have available data that can help to understand what happened so application can be improved and prevent replications.
In this article we will learn how to use Application Insights and automatic profiler to find root cause for past incidents and prepare logging platform to ensure meaningful data for analysis.

David would like to start talking about the difference between synchronous processing and real time processing of data. 
 
Uli discusses the pros and cons of ‘real-enough-time’.

Norm then provided a couple of examples where architectures can go wrong. This is where architectures go and introduce a very complex technical solution to a very simple business solution and the idea here is if you…]]></summary>

Lundi 24 avril je ferai une présentation, en français et en direct, sur comment débuter avec VS Code, Codespaces et Copilot. Durant cette présentation nous allons explorer comment c'est trois outils qui peuvent nous aider à développer plus rapidement et plus efficacement.
Reservez votre place dès maintenant, et apportez vos questions!

Pour vous donner un avant-goût, voici quelques vidéos que j'ai réalisés (en anglais) pour démontrer comment Copilot peut aider, peu importe le langage que vous utilisez.
 
Use Copilot to generate SQL and C# code for you

 
 
Use Copilot to generate HTML and Ruby

 
Use Copilot to generate Powershell and Markdown code for you

Sample error message : "statusMessage":"{\"error\":{\"code\":\"Conflict\",\"message\":\"Namespace provisioning in transition. For more information visit https://aka.ms/eventhubsarmexceptions.
 
Reason:
The reason for stuck state of EventHub namespace or its provisioning failure is due to a known race condition which initiates between two or more internal microservices from premium EventHub  architecture from different namespaces. If we trigger a Premium namespace provisioning and an event hub creation right after that then this race condition initiates and both …]]></summary>

Azure Cache for Redis has become an increasingly popular in-memory caching solution for many organizations and developers. However, the growing popularity of Redis means there is a corresponding growing need for even higher throughput and scale. Azure now offers the Enterprise and Enterprise Flash tiers of Azure Cache for Redis. These tiers are built on Redis Enterprise, rather than open-source Redis, which offers increased performance through a transparent multi-shard design that takes advantage of multiple vCPUs.  
We put the Enterprise tier of Azure Cache for Redis to the test to see what kind of performance boost this offering provides. We used Redis-benchmark, one of the most popular Redis benchmarking tools, to do some simple benchmarking of GET commands. While the performa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure provides built-in diagnostics to assist with debugging an App Service web app. The primary aim of this blog is to guide one step-by-step to add instrumentation to your application, as well as how to access the information logged.
 
Step 1:
Go to >App Service Logs> Enable Application Logging (Blob) and select the desired Blob Storage and the Container and select the Level of logging.
 

 
For more information on different types of logs you can refer this document.
 
Step 2:
Below is the code we have deployed a .Net Core MVC web application in a Windows App Service.
 
 
 public IActionResult Index()
        {
            _logger.LogInformation("This is a test to send logs to : Blob ");

            return View();
        }

        public IActionResult Privacy()
        {
            return View();
        }
 
 
Below are different level of logs details which you can log:
 

 




Note: If you write logs to blobs, the retention policy no longer applies if you delete the app but keep the logs in the blobs. For more information, see Costs that might accrue after resource deletion.




 
Step 3:
Go to Storage Account> Container and select the folder with your app service name and download the ( .txt ) file to check the logs.
 

 
The Blob option also includes additional information in the log messages, such as the ID of the origin VM instance of the log message (InstanceId), thread ID (Tid), and a more granular timestamp (EventTickCount) in a ( .csv ) file.

This distributed microservices architecture allows multiple teams within large organizations to operate independently of each other and release new versions of their microservices at their own cadence. However, this requires an additional level of supervision to address observability, traffic management, and security use cases for service-to-service communication across these distributed workloads. This can be done by embedding logic directly within the application code of each microservice. Or it can be done in a transparent way using service mesh which deploys sidecars to application pods to achieve the same use cases…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Workload Identity is an open-source project that enables Federated Identity in Kubernetes clusters. It is the next evolution of a public preview feature in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), that is built on the now deprecated pod identity project. Azure AD Workload Identity, is simpler to use and replaces pod identity. Azure AD Workload Identity on AKS is now generally available so customers can run production workloads using Workload Identity on both Windows and Linux and migrate applications using Pod Identity over to Workload Identity. 
 
Azure AD Workload Identity leverages Service Account Token Volume Projection giving pods the ability to use a Kubernetes identity (service account), to which a Kubernetes token is issued and OIDC federation which enables Kubernetes applications to access Azure cloud resources securely with Azure Active Directory based on annotated service accounts.
 
Since the open-source pod identity project is now deprecated, AKS will continue to support the AKS pod identity through 2023. To ease the transition, customers can run Pod Identity and Workload Identity in parallel on an existing AKS cluster.  Please note that during the Public Preview we enabled the sidecar to give customers time to update their SDKs, but this is not a supported configuration for General Availability. We recommend that customers update applications to a list of supported SDKs that will allow applications to talk to the AAD endpoint.]]></summary>

With workloads configured to consume only the necessary resources and dynamically scale to meet demand, businesses can optimize resource usage while reducing downtime. Additionally, Kubernetes allows organizations to deploy multiple applications from various teams or business units to a single cluster, resulting in significantly reduced infrastructure costs. However, this multitenancy approach poses a new challenge.
 
Consider this scenario: your cluster generates $100/day in infrastructure spend with a shared set of resources split across 10 developer teams. If 1 team consumes 80% of the cluster’s resources, it does not make sense to split infrastructure costs evenly across all teams at $10/day. Instead, your organ…]]></summary>

When customers decide to expand their existing Horizon infrastructure to Cloud, VMware recommends a multi-site Horizon implementation using a multi-instance model with separate instances per site. Each instance works independently, with its own set of App Volumes Managers and its own database instance. Using separate instances per site is simple to implement and allows for easy scaling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure provides built-in diagnostics to assist with debugging an App Service app. You can send your logs from your App Service to Storage Accounts, Event Hubs, or Log Analytics.
 
This blog will guide you step-by-step to enable AppServiceHTTPLogs , AppServiceAppLogs and view them in Log Analytics.
 
Step 1:
Go to Azure Portal > App Service > Diagnostic Settings and enable the required settings you would like to send to the destination . In this blog I have taken an example of HTTP Logs and App Service Application Logs in a Windows App Service ( .Net Core ).
 

 
You can refer this doc for more details on supported log types.
 
Step 2:
In your application code you can use the usual logging options and send log messages to application logs. By default, ASP.NET Core uses the Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.AzureAppServices logging provider. For more information, see ASP.NET Core logging in Azure.
 
Below is the code snippet of the logging I am doing in my .Net Core MVC webapp.
 

 
 
Step 3:
Go to Azure Portal > Log Analytics workspace > Logs and query the AppServiceAppLogs table and you can see the logs being sent. You can use different levels of logging such as Error, Information, Verbose and etc. in your application and this will show up in your logs in Log Analytics under the “Level” field. You can filter out logs based on the level:
 

 
Similarly, you can also query AppServiceHTTPLogs:
 

 
Sample Queries in Log Analytics:
 




AppServiceAppLogs
| where TimeGenerated >ago(10m)
 
AppServiceHTTPLogs
| where TimeGenerated >ago(10m)




 
 
More information:

AppServiceAppLogs is now available for ASP .NET apps on Windows - Azure App Service

When partitioning by first letter, we can either create a computed column on the first letter or use a range partition. However, the most elegant solution is to use only the letter itself, as it follows a predictable order regardless of the length of the key field.
 
As a bonus, I’m showing here how you can load the data in parallel to different letter-based tables and then switch in those tables to unified tables. This will enable you to load data very fast, more details in another blog post that I wrote (Efficiently Generating and Loading 1 Billion Rows into a Relational Database Content in just an hour - Microsoft Community Hub).

Dans la majorité des cas, pour gérer un projet à plusieurs, il faut au moins un outil de communication comme Slack ou Discord et un outil de gestion de projet comme Trello, Jira ou encore GitHub Projects. Dans cet article de blog, nous parlerons de la manière dont on peut gérer un projet avec GitHub Projects. Mais avant ça, parlons d’abord de GitHub et des différentes fonctionnalités qu’il propose.

Therefore, they usually enable private endpoint as well as configure Access Restriction to deny all the public traffic.
 
When the private endpoint is enabled and public traffic is denied to the web app, all the public traffic to this app is cut off. Since there is a range of IP addresses where agents are deployed, they have a public IP. Obviously, these agents are unable to reach web app.

 
As a solution, we can either allow the IP ranges list in the firewall or use self-hosted agents to deploy.

You can implement the server thumbprint in the .NET application code to resolve “Remote certificate is invalid” when multi-tenant web app is configured as client in client-server model and making HTTS request to a server configured with a private CA.
 
When a web app acts as a client and makes an HTTPS call to an external server secured by a private CA, the web app uses its default installed trusted root CA’s public key to validate the server’s certificate. However, the remote server certificate is signed by a private CA, and since there is no such trusted CA in the web app’s trusted source list, it will not be validated by the web app. You cannot modify th…]]></summary>

There's currently no SLA on how long it takes to replicate data to the destination account. In some cases, you might need to check the replication status, in this article we will go over the different methods that you can use to check and monitor the object replication status for the storage account.

To check the replication status for a blob in the source account in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

The technology: what is a container?
According to the Cloud Computing Dictionary a container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
In Linux, a container is a sandboxed process isolated from all other processes on the host machine. That isolation leverages kernel namespaces and cgroups, features that have been in Linux for a long time. Docker has worked to make these capabilitie…]]></summary>

Without any doubt, machine learning (ML) is one of the most transformative technological areas these days. Affordable cloud-based compute, complex and more efficient algorithms, plus accessible big data volumes helped to make incredible scientific breakthroughs in various fields and achieve (or even exceed) human parity with computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP).
 
Quality and variety of data is crucial to the machine learning’s generalisation and reliability of its outcomes. At the same time, there are certain situations where data may be rare or hard to find.

I know that many developers and testers love using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on Windows VMs via AVD, but that can be complex to install, and usually means users leverage personal (expensive!) VMs to support one-to-one installs.

The Dedicated plan guarantees single tenancy and specialized compute options including memory-optimized choices. In addition, the new Dedicated plan runs in the same Azure Container Apps environment as the serverless Consumption plan. This allows apps or microservice components that may have different resource requirements depending on component purpose or development stack to run in the same Azure Container Apps environment.  An…]]></summary>

Très souvent, les entreprises rencontrent des problèmes lorsqu'elles essaient d'automatiser des processus et de développer des applications. Les employés n'ont pas toujours des compétences en programmation nécessaires pour faire le travail eux-mêmes et comptent sur le département informatique pour le faire à leur place. Cependant, cela peut souvent entraîner des retards ou des rejets de projets.
 
Pour aider les entreprises à résoudre ce problème, Microsoft a créé la Power Platform. Cette plateforme permet aux employés de développer leurs propres applications, d'analyser des données et d'automatiser des processus sans avoir besoin de compétences en programmation. Cette approche est appelée "No Code"/"Low Code".

Azure DevOps is a set of tools for developers, project managers, and other contributors to work together on software development. It lets companies create and improve products more quickly than they could with older methods of software development. Azure DevOps has integrated features that you can access through your web browser or IDE client.
