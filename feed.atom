The previous version of Azure OpenAI Services Virtual Assistant was limited to being a client-side application, which required users to share two API keys, making it less secure and not suitable for production. Additionally, monitoring usage and preparing for course assessments on using OpenAI Chatgpt was challenging. Finally, cost-saving was also a concern.To address these issues, we have developed a serverless solution using Azure Static Web Apps. This new solution eliminates the need for users to share API keys, provides better monitoring of usage, and reduces costs. With Azure Static Website, users can access the virtual assistant through a secure and reliable serverless platform, making it an ideal choice for both students and professionals alike.

In this post, I'll walk you through the steps involved, which include:

creating an "azure.yaml" file via `azd init`
adding a "main.parameters.json" file
properly tagging your resource group and resources with `azd-env-name`
for deployment targets, add the corresponding `azd-service-name` tag as defined in "azure.yaml"

To demonstrate the process, I collaborated with my colleague Farhat Saleem in the Customer Success Team to azd-ify a sample integration app template that guides users through the process of setting up API Management policy for sending data to Azure …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are launching a new way to pay for Azure Spring Apps -- the consumption pricing plan. This plan is now in public preview so you can start creating and deploying apps today. This new plan is super-efficient because you can start from zero and scale to zero vCPU.  You get more straightforward pricing across your containerized applications since it costs the same as Azure Container Apps, but with added value for Spring apps.
 
How does this work? With the new plan, you can deploy apps that don’t need to run all the time or apps that have bursts of traffic and only pay for the resources used. This is a “serverless plan”, which means your apps can scale out and in automatically depending on the number of HTTP requests or events they receive or simply run as always-on background jobs.

However, if you need to transfer files (custom log files, network captures, etc.) from your container app to another destination such as your local machine or Azure Blob Storage, you might find that the process is not as straightforward as you'd like.
In this post, we'll walk you through the steps to transfer files from your Azure Container App to Azure Blob Storage using the `curl` command. Once the file is present on your Blob Storage, you can easily download it to your local machine from the Azure Portal itself in case you need to analyze the logs or network traces with a local tool.

And for me, validating incoming data is best done file by file, as the files arrive! On Azure there is no better platform for that then Azure Functions.

Although AAD-backed authentication has been an option for Service Bus for some time already, until now, users of the JMS 2.0 API still had to resort to local authentication using Shared Access Signatures (SAS). This new release brings a welcome change as it allows users to leverage AAD-based authentication, using service principals, and system- and user assigned managed identities.

After creating and populating a database, the next step is providing access to its data through an API. If you’ve ever faced a scenario like this, you’ve probably written code to create, read, update, or delete, known as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each endpoint. What if there was a way to simplify this step?
 
What is Data API builder?
The Data API Builder is a Microsoft open-source engine that converts REST and GraphQL into database queries. With the Data API builder, you can generate code based on your database schema that’s accessible through a REST or GraphQL API that will work with any language, platform, or device. It also comes with support for behaviors for organizing the data that require additional code, like pagination, f…]]></summary>

Solution Consideration – The Middleware
Before building an application, you should think and break down what you want to do before building. This process is often called "Solution Architecting". While we will not be taking a lot of time doing this, I would like to introduce you to the basics of it.
 
In our session case, we will look at the following:

The Frontend built with Power Apps; you can learn more about How to build a canvas app 
The Middleware that allows us to run the background process of our Asset Manager solution. This can be configured by using Approval flows within Power Automate 
The Backend allows us to store all the data from our solution, and to achieve this, we will Set up tables in Microsoft Dataverse


 
The Process Flow
When configuring a process that your Power Automate flow must follow, there is usually some set of steps business stakeholders often ask the automation builder to implement.

This is the last in the three part sub-series looking at the newly launched Data API builder for Azure Databases (DAB) and while last time we looked at creating a React application, this time I wanted to look at how to do the same thing but in .NET using Blazor. So let's jump in and learn about how to use SWA Data Connections with Blazor.
Oh, and for something different, let's try also use a SQL backend rather than Cosmos DB.
Setting up DAB
When we've looked at DAB so far, we've had to create two files, a config for DAB and a GraphQL schema containing the types. Well since we're using SQL this time we can drop the GraphQL schema file, as DAB will use the SQL schema to generate the types, something it couldn't do fro…]]></summary>

In the last post I introduced you to a new project we've been working on, Data API builder for Azure Databases (DAB) and in this post I want to look at how we can use it in Azure, and that will be through one of my favourite Azure services, Azure Static Web Apps, for you see, as part of the announcement today of DAB, we've announced that it is available as a feature of SWA (called Database Connections), so let's build a React app!
Local Development
One of the neat things about working with SWA is that we have a CLI tool which emulates the functionality of SWA, and with today's announcement, we can use it to emulate the Database Connections feature, so let's get started. First off, we need to ensure we have the lates…]]></summary>

I'm really excited because today we launched the first public preview of Data API builder for Azure Databases or DAB for short (the official name is a bit of a mouthful ­;p).
The important links you'll need are:

SQL announcement
Cosmos announcement

SWA integration announcement

What is DAB
DAB is a joint effort from the Azure SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL and Cosmos DB teams to provide a simple and easy way to create REST and GraphQL endpoints from your existing database. Now obviously this is something that you've always been able to do, but the difference is that DAB does it for you (after all, that's the point of this series) so rather than having to write an ASP.NET application, data layer, authentica…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB) for SQL Server in Azure VMware Solution (AVS) is now Generally Available (GA). This new capability enables customers to create an Azure VMware Solution placement policy and specify the number of hosts using the Azure Hybrid Benefit. With this enabled, it will unlock unlimited virtualization through the SQL Server licenses with Software Assurance. 
 
With this release, customers can take advantage of Azure Hybrid Benefit on their Azure VMware Solution nodes by running their SQL Server workloads on AVS by applying existing paid SQL Server Enterprise licenses with active Software Assurance. As a result of this, the VMs on the nodes running SQL Server will be licensed using the unlimited virtualization benefit available with SQL Server licenses that have Software Assurance. To get started, customers can use the Azure portal to configure and enable VM-Host affinity placement policies through the AVS menu and create placement policies with APIs.  
 
For more information on Azure Hybrid Benefit, please visit Azure Hybrid Benefit—hybrid cloud | Microsoft Azure. In addition, visit Enable SQL Azure hybrid benefit for Azure VMware Solution to view how a customer can enable SQL AHB on Azure VMware Solution. 
 
@Varun_Hariharan, Product Manager at Microsoft explains the benefits and how to enable the SQL Hybrid Benefit for your Azure VMware Solution.

In the on-premises world, tape storage is a system in which magnetic tape is used as a recording media to store data. With rapidly growing data volumes, tape storage is the most suitable system for data storage requiring large capacity in the on-premises systems. Tape storage is not used only for backup in case of system failure, but also for archiving data for long-term storage.
 
Tape backup is a term typically applied to old/outdated technologies, but tapes are still being used to back up the data. Many large enterprises like banks, hospitals, telecommunication organizations rely on tapes to ensure important data is securely stored for long term usage.

Azure Application Insights is a powerful tool for monitoring the performance and availability of your applications. By sending web requests to your application at regular intervals from Application Insight’s servers around the world, it can alert you if your application isn't responding or responds too slowly. Since it is a useful tool to check the server's availability, some users may integrate the availability test feature of Application Insight with the API management service.
 
As the Application Insights server is in the public network, we need to ensure that the API Management’s endpoints should be accessible from the public internet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many in education, Microsoft Teams is the collaboration platform that allows students and educators to chat, share files, and collaborate on projects. Like many apps, Microsoft Teams uses cache to store temporary data, such as chat history and files. While the cache is useful for improving performance, it can also become cluttered over time and slow down the app. Deleting the cache can help improve Microsoft Teams performance by reducing the amount of temporary data stored which can also free up storage space. 
 
The Microsoft Teams cache can be deleted manually by deleting all the files and folders in the %appdata%\Microsoft\Teams directory for each user profile. This however can be tedious and can be automated using PowerShell via one line of script.
 
 
 
 
Get-ChildItem -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Teams" -Recurse | Remove-Item -Force -Recurse
 
 
 
 
Note: It's important to close the Microsoft Teams app on all devices and clear the cache for all users to ensure that the cache is completely cleared.
 
Please leave any feedback or questions about how to improve the script shared above in the comments section below.

In this article, we will look at Microsoft Power Platform and specifically Canvas apps. We will at Power Platform in a specific way namely debugging. 

So what do we mean by debugging? When you code, you need to figure out that the code does what it should. For example, you are fetching data from somewhere and you want to transform it in such a way that you're able to get the data you need from it and can display it.  

As a developer, you have a few different approaches you use for "debugging" namely:

In the following example, function app tonytesthttp has been linked to static web app.
 

 
When we try to access the function app outside static webapp, we will encounter Bad Request error. We understand that the static web app must do something to block the request. We can try to unlink the function app from static web app. However, you will find the function app still encounters the same error. How can we make our function app back to normal?
 

 
If you read the official document (Bring your own functions to Azure Static Web Apps | Microsoft Learn) carefully, you will find following statement.
 
If authentication and authorization policies aren't already set up on your existing Functions app, then the static web app has exclusive access to the API. To make your Functions app accessible to other applications, add another identity provider or change the security settings to allow unauthenticated access.
 
It seems that the link operation will add authentication limitation to only allow static webapp to access the function app. If you navigate to the authentication setting of the function app, you will find the static webapp was added as an identity provider. Even we unlink the function app to static webapp, the identity provider will not be removed automatically. We need to remove the identity provider manually.

 Although WordPress is an excellent content management system (CMS), it isn’t without its issues. Sometimes its admin panel can be laggy, preventing you from easily managing your website. We have always made sure that WordPress on Azure App Service meets the performance requirements of our customers. However, we got to learn from customer feedback that we could do better for the admin persona. So we have enhanced the offering with accelerated performance for admin pages.
 
 If you have created the website before 1 March 2023, please follow the steps described in blog post here: How to improve performance of WP Admin - WordPress on Azure App Service - Microsoft Community Hub to improve your WP Admin & overall site performance.
 
Support and Feedback
 
In case you need any support, you can open a support request at New support request - Microsoft Azure.
 
If you have any ideas about how we can make WordPress on Azure App Service better, please post your ideas at Post idea · Community (azure.com)

Using Hyper-V, students can install multiple operating systems and applications on a single physical machine. In a previous blog post, we covered steps to enable Hyper-V in Windows 11 via the Graphic User Interface (GUI). However, as many pointed out, there is a quicker way to accomplish this.
 
PowerShell is a more efficient and effective method for creating a virtual machine (VM) on Hyper-V, but what exactly is it? PowerShell combines a command-line shell, a scripting language, and a configuration management framework into a single, cross-platform tool for automating routine tasks.

Authentication is the process of verifying client or server identity before accessing resources to protect information security. Azure App Service provides sets of authentication technologies to protect and secure your web application. However, it is a steep learning curve to know all of them, and we often get lost in the details of documentations. The purpose of this article is to give you an intuitive way to understand the authentication features in App Service and a high-level summary of different authentication models and their usage scenarios.
 
Speaking about authentication in App Service, we can make an analogy with network traffic that there is incoming calls and outgoing calls. Similarly, authentications also have …]]></summary>

There is a symptom with low throughput in Service Bus triggered function due to Service Bus's message session enabled. This blog we're going to do a lab to demonstrate the cause and effect of this situation.
 
Common causes:
According to session features description (Azure Service Bus message sessions - Azure Service Bus | Microsoft Learn), since a session receiver is created by a client accepting a session. When the session is accepted and held by a client, the client holds an exclusive lock on all messages with that session's session ID in the queue or subscription. It will also hold exclusive locks on all messages with the session ID that will arrive later.

Hence, if all the messages are with same session id, there is only one receiver can consume these messages one by one…]]></summary>

Creating test data is an important task for developers and data analysts alike. However, manually creating test data can be time-consuming and error prone. In this video, Thomas and Stijn demonstrate how to generate test data using Azure OpenAI GPT-3 within Spark in Synapse Analytics.
 
OpenAI GPT-3 is a powerful natural language AI model that can understand text and generate new text based on that input. By leveraging the prompts available through OpenAI, it is possible to generate a dataset that can be used for testing purposes.
 
Thomas and Stijn showcase how to create a single dataset into a dataframe and multiple dataframes that have a relationship with each other. This enables developers and data analysts to build specific test data for their own environments.
 
By using Azure OpenAI GPT-3 within Spark in Synapse Analytics, developers and data analysts can generate test data quickly and accurately. This saves time and ensures that the test data is representative of the production data, allowing for more effective testing.
 

 
In conclusion, generating test data is a critical task for developers and data analysts. Using Azure OpenAI GPT-3 within Spark in Synapse Analytics enables users to quickly and accurately generate test data that is representative of production data. This is a powerful tool that can help developers and data analysts be more productive and effective in their work.

Databases are where information about your application is stored and managed. For example, if you are registering new users, you will need to store data on their username, password, and other details. Other than just storage, you may need to ensure your data is safe and easily scalable. This is where database systems come in handy. The two most used are relational databases and NoSQL databases. While this post will cover the basic differences between relational and NoSQL databases, you can read more about what to consider when deciding which database to use.

When working with SAS, in case a SAS gets compromised, to prevent any un-authorized access via that SAS, the only option to revoke SAS is to recycle the Access Keys being used to sign the SAS. This in turn will affect all the SAS that have been signed using those set of keys. Also, if you are using those keys anywhere in the application, you will have to update the configuration on all those places.
 
To prevent this, we can make use of a stored access policy. The advantage of using the storage access policy is that you can control expiry time and permissions. Furthermore, if SAS gets compromised, you can edit the permissions of the SAS, make it expired or even delete the access policy …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background:
Function App supports to integrate Managed Identities to connect to resources that support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. There are two types of Managed Identities: System-assigned and User-assigned. However, customer would choose User-assigned Managed Identity when the use case is like the workloads that run on multiple resources and can share a single identity or the workloads where resources are recycled frequently, but permissions should stay consistent. In this blog, we're going to introduce how to assign a User-Assigned Managed Identity (MI) to Function App that use Azure AD for authorization to access Event Hub resource in Event Hub trigger.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On 30 September 2023, Azure Automation will retire Run As accounts, and completely move to Managed identities. All runbook executions using Run As accounts, including Classic Run As accounts would not be supported after this date. Moreover, starting 1 April 2023, creation of new Run As accounts in Azure Automation will not be possible. Renewing of certificates for existing RunAs accounts would be possible only till the end of support.
To ensure you are using a supported authentication method, you must migrate all your runbooks to Managed Identities.
 
Benefits of Managed identities

Secure authentication to any Azure service that supports Azure AD authentication.
Minimised management overhead with easy access to resources.
No need of Certificate renewals as in case of Run As accounts.
Simplified runbooks with no requirement to use multi-line code.

 
Take immediate action

Review your Automation accounts, Runbooks, GitHub code samples to identify Remove all references to Run As accounts and make necessary changes to reflect Managed Identities only.
If you have existing Azure Automation runbooks using Run As accounts, you must migrate them to Managed identities.
If your Run As account certificate is expiring, it’s a good time to start using Managed identities for authentication instead of renewing the certificate.
Do not create new Run As accounts, ensure to use Managed identities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Arc for Azure VMware Solution? Simply put, it exposes your Azure VMware Solution resources (VMs, networks, datastores, etc.) to the Azure portal.
 
Using Arc for Azure VMware Solution, those resources can be managed via the Azure portal, even though they are within your vSphere cluster running in an Azure datacenter. Even better, there is no cost to deploy Arc for Azure VMware Solution. More blogs to come on Arc for Azure VMware Solution, but if you want to get some more details check out this video from Jeremiah Megie.
 
First things first. Let’s get Arc for Azure VMware Solution installed into your private cloud.
You will need to collect the following information to input into the PowerShell script, which, if you use it, will make the deployment a bit more straightforward.
 

Subscription ID and Resource Group where the Azure VMware Solution private cloud is deployed.
 Name of the Azure VMware Solution private cloud.
 /28 network segment for the ARC appliance.


The/28 network segment will be an NSX-T segment in the private cloud. Under the covers, the deployment script creates NSX-T segment for use by the ARC appliances. The value must be entered into the script as the gateway to the segment, followed by /28. For example, if 192.168.99.1/28 is entered, there will be a /28 NSX-T segment created with the gateway 192.168.99.1.
 
The other information you can get from the Overview blade of your private cloud.
 

 
Requirements

Your private cloud must have Internet access.
Also, because of the appliance size, ideally you would want to run this script as close to the private cloud, or from a machine inside the AVS Private Cloud.

The script can be found here;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure and Red Hat have had a long-standing partnership to provide customers with best-in-class cloud solutions, such as jointly-supported Azure Red Hat OpenShift, JBoss EAP on Azure App Service, and deployment templates for JBoss EAP on Azure RHEL VM’s. Organizations which are moving existing, on-premises deployments to the cloud at scale need purpose-built tooling that can help automate the process of analyzing their portfolio of applications for cloud readiness. To bridge that gap, we are excited to announce that Microsoft Azure has begun contributing to Red Hat’s Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA), a tool that supports large-scale Java application modernization and migration projects across a broad range of transformations and use cases by automating source-code analysis and providing line-by-line recommendations to migrate your applications to new Java runtimes or the Azure cloud. These contributions to the Red Hat MTA provide service-specific migration recommendations for Azure App Service.
 

 
The collaboration adds rulesets to the open source upstream of the MTA, known as Windup. These new rules search for some common scenarios and provide guidance for accomplishing the task in Azure:

Configuring data sources
Java Key Store usage for certificates
Using Maven to deploy to App Service
Proper use of the file system in Azure
Using Azure Service Bus for JMS
Using Azure Active Directory as an identity provider
… and more!

 
Check out this Video Demo for more information.
 
You can download the web or CLI client of the Migration Toolkit for Applications from the Red Hat’s website or install it as a VS Code plugin.

We recommend all users migrate the Azure API Management service from stv1 compute platform to the stv2 compute platform to take advantage of upcoming features.
 
This article is to describe and compare the stv1 and stv2 compute platform to provide users with more perspectives.
In addition, this article introduces recommended migration solutions to help users on compute platform migration.

One method is to use a private endpoint, also known as a private link, in Azure Static Web Apps. This feature enables developers to connect network isolated backends to Azure Static Web Apps resources for increased security and seamless routing. In this blog post, we'll go through how to set up a private endpoint in Azure Static Web Apps and the advantages it has for keeping your web apps secure.
 
Now a private endpoint, also known as a private link, is a network interface that connects to your virtual network using a private IP address.

WP Admin: Also called the backend, admin panel, or admin dashboard, this is the admin area where you can manage your website. You can edit posts and pages, install themes and plugins, add or remove users, and change website settings.
Frontend: This is the section which is accessible to your users. This is where your users can read blog posts, make purchases, or participate in a forum, depending on the kind of website you build using WordPress.

We are seeing two sets of user trends along the Kubernetes adoption curve.

Updates to Microsoft Intune

Let's look at each of these updates in greater detail.
 
Mobile > Azure Active Directory
 Mobile Azure AD releases increased user capabilities.
 
Building on the initial Azure AD Mobile experience, a new release in December 2022 introduces more user capabilities. This includes enabling users to view their extended profile details and sign-in logs, view other users extended details, search for users within the active tenant, and inviting guest users.
All of these capabilities are contingent on the user having the correct level of permissions to do so. The next release, targeted for late February, will introduce more capabilities for groups.
 

Select the Azure AD card from the Azure Mobile App Home View. Users do not need to have subscriptions to be able to access Azure AD as seen below:

We’ve tried to keep the workspace administration UI stable without making too many changes, but it’s time for a refresh.
 
Today we start rolling out a revamped workspace menu that will help you get to the things you need quicker. Key items are now right at the top, where you expect them to be:

 
The new menu is gradually being exposed, so you might not see it immediately.
 
As part of this change, we're also clearly indicating menu options that are in the process of replacement or deprecation. Here are the relevant options and their replacement:

To prevent unauthorized access to a Service Fabric cluster, you must secure the cluster. Security is especially important when the cluster runs production workloads. This article describes how to configure node-to-node and client-to-node security by using Windows security, where gMSA is the preferred security model.
 
A standalone Managed Service Account (sMSA) is a managed domain account that provides automatic password management, simplified service principal name (SPN) management and the ability to delegate the management to other administrators.

Soon every application on every platform will incorporate some ML capabilities, empowering the application itself and making it smarter.
This is the key reason why ML has been added into the .NET ecosystem a few years back, by creating an open-source framework (ML.NET) which enables developers to train, build and ship custom ML models for a wide range of scenarios (sentiment analysis, forecasting, recommendations and more).

Let's go find out about dark data and let's go talk to our architects.

Connectors are integration points that help your APIs connect to Microsoft Power Platform. If you have never built a connector before and you enjoy working with APIs, check this article to help you get started. When creating your connector, you are presented with 4 authentication configuration options to ensure successful connection to your API - No Authentication, Basic Authentication, API Key and OAuth 2.0. This article will focus on the configuration of OAuth 2.0 as your authentication type. 

Note: A connector only serves as a proxy for your external service, therefore it must be configured to use the authentication that is implemented by your API.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot on the heels of Spring Boot 3.0.2, I am excited to announce the 0.3 release of Spring Modulith.
The release is packed with improvements.
We have tweaked a couple of things that might require your attention and a couple of adapting changes to your code.
The most notable changes are:





GH-114 – We renamed the ….modulith.model package to ….modulith.core. This primarily affects ApplicationModules. Please adapt your imports accordingly.



GH-120 – The documentation support now generates diagram files using the *.puml file extension, as suggested by PlantUML. Please adapt your imports accordingly.



GH-103 – ApplicationModuleInitializer implementations will be triggered upon application startup, in the order following the application module dependency structure (more core ones are invoked first). Also, ApplicationModules exposes a ….getComparator() to order Spring beans that way. Note, that this requires the JGraphT library to be on the classpath (automatically pulled in via the spring-modulith-runtime artifact). See the reference documentation for details.



GH-116 – PublishedEvents now sees events published from asynchronous event listeners, too.



GH-100 – If you’re using AssertJ in your tests, you can now use AssertablePublishedEvents for a more streamlined integration  (for example, assertThat(events).contains(MyEvent.class).matching(…)).



GH-117 – As we incentivize event-based, asynchronous application module integration, the test starter now also pulls in Awaitility.



GH-111 – We now publish aggregated Javdoc.





Find a complete change log in the GitHub release page. We are looking forward to your feedback in the GitHub discussions.]]></summary>

This blog post details new noteworthy and explains some of the new filters included, how they work and how you can use it to provide more insights into your applications.

First of all, let’s talk about cache! Cache is a complicated issue and that’s why we have introduced two new filters related to it, but take into account that these filters can make the gateway memory constrained so use them carefully.

Manipulating the request body can cause issues if not done properly, so we made it easy for you; with this filter we offer the possibility to cache the request body before it to the downstream and get that body from an exchange attri…]]></summary>

Microsoft Azure Data Explorer is a great resource to ingest and process streaming data. Azure Data Lake Storage is a great resource for storing large amounts of data. The end-to-end conceptual architecture contained in the GitHub Repository accompanying this blog focuses on deploying an environment that plays to the strengths of both of these services by using Azure Synapse Analytics to simulate streaming data to them. In this architecture, the core strength of Azure Data Explorer is performant real-time storage and analytics. The core strength of Azure Data Lake Storage is cost-effective and efficient long-term storage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What’s New?
The Change Tracking and Inventory service tracks changes to Files, Registry, Software, Services and Daemons and uses the MMA (Microsoft Monitoring Agent)/OMS (Operations Management Suite) agent. This preview supports the new AMA agent and enhances the following:

Security/Reliability and Scale - The Azure Monitor Agent enhances security, reliability, and facilitates multi-homing experience to store data.
Simplified onboarding- You can onboard to Virtual Machines directly to Change Tracking (add link) without needing to configure an Automation account. In new experience, there is
Rules management – Uses Data Collection Rules to configure or customize various aspects of data collection. For example, you can change the frequency of file collection. DCRs let you configure data collection for specific machines connected to a workspace as compared to the "all or nothing" approach of legacy agents.

How to get started?
You can onboard to Change Tracking & Inventory with AMA either via Azure Portal or by using Azury Policy (to onboard at scale). To onboard single VM via portal, click on specific VM name from Virtual Machines -> Change Tracking -> Enable using AMA agent (Preview). To know more about the various methods to enable Change Tracking, click here
Onboarding from Single VM view

 
Onboarding via DINE Policies (at scale onboarding)

In the public preview, Change Tracking with AMA supports Window Files, Windows Registry and Software data types. We are working towards facilitating the support of Windows services & Linux Daemons by GA. The data configuration can now be regulated at DCR level now. Click here to know more about Data Collection Rules.
 
You can check out our complete documentation to get more details. We’d love to hear what you like and don’t like about this feature, and where you’d like us to take it. Please click here to Sign Up and try out the new enhancements.]]></summary>

For example, roles in program management, product management, sales, and marketing may not require coding skills, although a basic understanding of technology can be useful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note that official support for PHP 8 will only be available on Linux, as a result of this App Service will only support PHP 8 on Apps Service Linux instances. For additional information on this topic: PHP on App Service, php.internals: Microsoft Support of PHP on Windows.
 
This article will demonstrate on how to use PHP 8 for App Service Windows, since there would be no official support from Microsoft for it, please use at your own risk.
 
Generally, we are following this post: How to use a Custom PHP runtime for App Service Windows - (azureossd.github.io) to download a custom PHP runtime and map Handler for it.
 
1. Create a new Web app for Windows using any available Runtime stack for Windows.

 
2. After the creation complete, go to Kudu site from Azure Portal:

 
3. Create a new directory and download the PHP runtime(Non Thread Safe Version) from PHP For Windows: Binaries and sources Releases and extract it, in this demo, we use php 8.2.1, the output is as below:
 
 
mkdir php
curl https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.2.1-nts-Win32-vs16-x64.zip -o php\php.zip
cd php
unzip php.zip
 
 


 
4. Go to Path mappings in configuration. Add a new handler mapping. The extension is "*.php", the Script processor is "C:\home\php\php-cgi.exe". Then save it. All the configuration is done.

 
5. To verify it, we can create an "index.php" file under C:\home\site\wwwroot with below content. The result would look like as below:
 
<?
phpinfo();
 
 

 
I hope you enjoy it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Symptoms: 
 

  Uploading files using Java SDK class DataLakeFileClient fails to initiate the ADF trigger. 
  Uploading files using Azure Portal initiates the trigger as expected. 
  ADF trigger is configured to ignore empty blobs. 

 
Analysis: 
 

Whenever a file is created using ADLS Gen2 REST API, there are 3 operations called at the backend i.e. CreateFile, AppendFile and FlushFile.
Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated event is triggered when a blob is created or replaced. Specifically, this event is triggered when clients use the CreateFile and FlushWithClose operations that are available in the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 REST API.
As CreateFile API created a 0 byte blob, the event will not be triggered. 

 
Resolution: 
 

You can initiate the trigger by adding FlushWithResponse method with close parameter as true.

Example: 
 
        boolean close = true;
File file = new File("C:\\Users\\mahmoudsamy\\route.txt");
        fileClient.uploadFromFile("C:\\Users\\mahmoudsamy\\route.txt");
        fileClient.flushWithResponse(file.length(), retainUncomittedData, close, httpHeaders, requestConditions, timeout, contect);
 
Note: Please make sure to pass the correct parameters when using FlushWithResponse to avoid unexpected results.]]></summary>

Instead of trusting that all resources within an organization's firewall are secure, Zero Trust assumes that all access requests, regardless of origin or destination, should be considered as originating from an untrusted network.
 
Guiding principles for the Zero Trust security strategy are as follows: 

Verify explicitly: All available data points must be used to authenticate and approve users, devices, and requests.
Use least privilege access: Users and devices are allowed the bare minimum of access required to execute their functions, and that access is reviewed and revoked when it is no longer required.

The current method does not obey the recommendation of Docker that a docker container should host only one service, and we actually recommend customers use Azure Container App for hosting multiple applications.

We will create a Docker container to have nginx installed and use it as a reverse proxy to redirect the request from external to different applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a developer, you're likely familiar with the concept of "quotas" when it comes to using cloud-based services. These limits are put in place to ensure that resources are used efficiently and to prevent any one user from consuming too many resources. In this post, we'll take a look at how quotas are affected by Codespaces and provide some suggestions for avoiding the limits on free Codespaces.
 
Before getting into the suggestions, it's important to recognize two key features of how Codespaces effect quotas: 

Every Codespace that has been created (but not deleted) has the potential to deplete your included quota.
Running Codespaces will use both CPU core-hours and storage, while stopped Codespaces will consume your storage quota only.

This may seem a bit controversial, but we’re going to talk about the roles and the relationships of architects themselves to the rest of the organization. People have this notion that architects are sitting up in the stone castle speaking their wisdom down to the peasants. Where did that come from and is this a common stereotype?
 
It may help to talk about our own failures. In my journey, early in my career, we thought it would be good to gather a whole group of really talented architects, think of them like chefs and put them in the same kitchen and say if we just funnel all of the organization's problems through this Center of Excellence with the cen…]]></summary>

1. What is Azure Managed Grafana?
Azure Managed Grafana is a data visualization platform built on top of the Grafana software by Grafana Labs. This is a bit different to the Grafana that you download from the grafana.com in the sense of the platform as Azure Managed Grafana is deployed from Azure Portal. 
 
Therefore, you can control and configure the settings of Azure Managed Grafana from the Azure Portal such as limiting access or permission via users by using Azure Active Directory from Access Control (IAM).

Today we are going a little deeper into what was discussed in the OT Cloud Enablement - Cloud Adoption Models article to explore Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant design considerations for an OT environment. Once the Azure AD tenant design has been finalised, decisions on Identity and Access Management (IAM), network topology and connectivity, resource organisation, security, management, governance and, platform automation and DevOps can then be made.
 
The importance of the Azure AD tenant design and why we are looking at this first is explained in the Cloud Adoption Framework …]]></summary>

In part 3 of this multi-part blog series, I am going to cover, as per the title ‘Architectural Cost Optimisation’.In prior posts I have spoken about foundational primitives, what you can change and tune in the cloud without changing your applications.But you know what? Architectures can evolve, and they should evolve fueled by business efficiency and cost savings.If you are an architect or developer joining us today, you are unbelievably lucky because with every day you get new levers to pull.The major two Hyperscalesrs (Azure and AWS) released more than 2000 new feature updates and or new services in 2022.

It started 4 years ago when ACR added support for Helm Chart distribution using the existing registry services users have already configured for their secure environments. We knew Helm adoption would require support across all registries which initiated the OCI Artifacts and ORAS projects.

But what if you want to test the system to make sure it can handle a desired number of requests per second (RPS) ? For example, you may want to load test a payment gateway service for the number of transactions that can be processed every second. RPS or throughput is a crucial metric that reveals fundamental information about the tested system. Every system has a critical point in terms of throughput. Once the system reaches the critical point, it might keep the throughput around the same level, but the response times go up  or the requests get throttled.

Unlike other effects that focus on resource configurations, the denyAction effect will block requests based on intended action, regardless of user permissions.  Today this new effect supports deletions, but it's set up to handle other types of actions in the future. With the at-scale power of Azure Policy and the ability to block delete calls, denyAction allows you to prevent accidental deletions of your critical resources. 
 
Sample denyAction definition that blocks delete calls on any virtual machines: 

 
You are able to create these definitions in Portal or API. All denyAction definitions will have a compliance state of 'Not Started' during preview, and will introduce a new compliance state of 'Protected' for GA.

I’ve been updating my blog, and a half dozen little side projects, to the new Spring Boot 3. This has given me a chance to do a little, shall we say, Spring cleaning, and also update my Github Actions to the latest and greatest. I’m pleasantly surprised by how many builds I’ve switched over to 3.0 and then used the AOT engine to build a GraalVM native image and it just worked!

Deny policy, as one policy type, is used to prevent a resource request that does not match defined standards through a policy definition and fails the request. For example, deny policies that prevent creating public IP addresses, network security groups, user-defined routes, or route tables.

It allows users to self-attest the compliance of resources or scopes. In another word, it gives users a chance to determine the compliance result of the specific resource and the reason. Currently, it is mostly used inside the Security related built-in policies and initiatives. In this post, I will briefly introduce what it looks like and how it works.
 
There are multiple built-in policies under the Security category to check the subscription level compliance results with manual effect. For the built-in example, you may check “Issue public key certificates” (policy definition ID: /providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/97d91b33-7050-237b-3e23-a77d57d84e13).

.NET 7 support for the isolated worker extension
According to the Azure Functions roadmap, Azure Functions isolated worker model has started supporting .NET 7. Therefore, this OpenAPI extension also starts supporting .NET 7 with the isolated worker model. The migration step is as easy as changing the target framework. Update your .csproj file and find the <TargetFramework> node, and change it from netcoreapp3.1 (.NET Core 3.1), net5.0 (.NET 5) or net6.0 (.NET 6), to net7.0 (.NET 7).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Case: In a situation, you observe your EventHub namespace is still incurring the cost, even though you are not doing any operations (read/write/management) on it and your EventHub namespace has no active EventHub instances present.
 
Root Cause of the behavior: 

At the time of creating the Azure EventHub namespace (Basic/Standard/Premium/Dedicated tier), you may have to give pre-purchased units of capacity in terms of Throughput units/Processing units/Capacity units based on the tier you choose. These pre-purchased units of capacity controls throughput capacity of the EventHub namespace.
Among all the other pricing factors, cost will be incurred based on the number of pre-purchased units of capacity (Throughput units/Processing units/Capacity units) at the EventHub namespace level.
Here I have attached a document, referring to the Azure EventHub pricing. Pricing - Event Hubs | Microsoft Azure

 

As the pre-purchased units of capacity (Throughput units/Processing units/Capacity units) are defined at the EventHub namespace level, you will be charged per pre-purchased units of capacity configured hourly, even though there are no active EventHub instances present, and you are not performing any kind of operations on it.

How to mitigate this behavior:

To stop the incurring cost while EventHub is not in use, you may have to delete the EventHub namespace, instead of disabling the EventHub instances.
You can as well export the ARM template to create the same EventHub namespace in future, before deleting the existing EventHub namespace. Export template in Azure portal - Azure Resource Manager | Microsoft Learn]]></summary>

As we all know, the API management service is nothing but a proxy that helps to forward the request and response between the client and the backend server. Ideally, the API Management server will maintain two connections: the one with the client side, and the one with the backend server. The backend server proceeds the request from APIM when SSL/TLS connection is successfully established between APIM and the backend server. However, if any of the elements within the SSL/TLS connection go wrong, the client server may receive a 500 BackendConnectionFailure error with the message ‘The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel.’

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce the release of auto-refresh of message counters on the queue overview blades in Service Bus portal experience. This feature updates the queue settings and message counters automatically in specific time intervals selected by the user to provide real time message counts within portal.
 
Queue settings and message counts
 
Every Service Bus queue overview blade on Azure Portal shows valuable information pertaining to the queue settings and messages on the queue. Some of the metrics exposed to users are as shown below:

 

 
Currently, the queue settings and message counts are only updated if the page is voluntarily refreshed by the user. A lot of users are interested in the metrics getting updated automatically when they are in an active queue without voluntarily reloading the page or refreshing the page. This also impacts customers flow introducing a context switch.
 
Enabling auto-refresh of message counters
 
The feature is set to “off” by default. Users are free to turn the Auto-refresh toggle to “on” and select the time interval at which they would like to see the counters refreshed automatically. Turning “on” the auto refresh feature selects 10 seconds refresh by default but users can select from 5 seconds to up to a 1 minute.
 
Steps to enable the feature –
Default – auto refresh is turned “off”

 
Toggle “on” the auto refresh to observe the Refresh after timer selected to 10 seconds by default.

 
Click to select more refresh timing option from the dropdown

Done, after you select, the auto refresh feature will be enabled on all the queues on your service bus namespace.
 
NOTES –

This feature once enabled will apply to all queues within the service bus namespace.
This is a portal specific feature. Hence, users cannot enable/ update/ disable the feature through PowerShell/ CLI]]></summary>

Web Apps - Swap Slot Slot - REST API (Azure App Service) | Microsoft Docs
 
However, we have recently found the following way to monitor the Swap operation and the same API is being used by Azure portal as well to update the Swap status and it's comparatively fast. Please refer to the steps below:
 

First call the POST Slot-Swap API & it will trigger the swap operation as shown below:

https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{SubscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{name}/slots/{slot}/slotsswap?api-version=2022-03-01
 
 

 
2. The above API will have location parameter in Response Headers with Operation Results API call which can be used to continuously poll in a loop until the Response is 200 (Swap completed) or (failure status code in case of swap failure)
 
GET: https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{SubscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{name}/slots/{slot}/operationresults/915677b6-ea92-44c9-865b-95cfc693d5bb?api-version=2018-11-01
 
Polling: Swap in accepted/in-progress state:
 

 
Polling: Swap completed:

Log compaction is a way of retaining data in Event Hubs using event key. By default, each event hub/Kafka topic is created with time-based retention or delete cleanup policy, where events are purged upon the expiration of the retention time. Rather using coarser-grained time based retention, you can use event key-based retention mechanism where Event Hubs retrains the last known value for each event key of an event hub or a Kafka topic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article details about a Lift and shift migration scenario which was tested successfully using Azure Migrate and is considered unique for two reasons.
 

The Virtual Machines were running Kubernetes workloads and all kinds of databases like Postgres, MySQL, Mongo DB etc.
IP retention was a prime requirement for the customer as they had certificates binded with the Load Balancer IP.

 
Customer had ~700+ Virtual machines running Kubernetes workloads from two environments (Dev and QA) and we migrated each environment in just a day and ensured that all the servers had their IP retained and their Kubernetes workloads started working exactly the same manner as how it used to work from on-premise. Planning of the migration (including replication time) etc went for 3 weeks and we migrated each environment over a weekend that included functional testing as well.  
 
Ofcourse, there was option to modernize the application by moving the workloads to AKS, but due to a strict migration timelines and customers inexperience in handling AKS we decided against it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last few years, we’ve received extensive feedback around the need for a better custom logs experience in Azure Monitor Logs. To address it, the team stepped back, analyzed needs in the space, and rebuilt from the ground-up the full custom logs feature set. The features have been in preview for several months now, being vetted by many Log Analytics customers including some of the largest retailers, banks, and healthcare providers in the world. With preview feedback addressed and services now fully scaled out to meet the complex needs of these users and more, we are today excited to announce the revamped custom logs features are now generally available!
 
Today, we are announcing the following:

GA of the Log Ingestion API. This secure, scalable, and flexible API is the path going forward for all custom data ingestion needs.
GA of the Ingestion-time Transformations feature. This feature allows users to customize built-in data streams to parse, enrich, filter, or otherwise tailor incoming data to their specific use-cases.
A pricing for data sent to the system and subsequently dropped in a transformation. A nominal fee per GB dropped will be charged for any data dropped beyond 50% of incoming data, calculated daily. The fee is waived for Azure Sentinel-enabled workspaces. While we're announcing billing today, we will not start charging yet as of this announcement, and will provide at least a 3-month notice before doing so. The Azure Monitor pricing page will be imminently updated with these details.

For those of you who participated in our preview - thank you for your feedback, and to those new to the features - we're excited for you to start using them! To learn more, please start with our docs, and don’t hesitate to reach out should you have any questions!]]></summary>

Java in teaching
Given the sheer size of the amount of Java developers in the world and that's it's used by most of the major companies makes Java a good choice to be taught in academia. There are many resources out there for teaching Java outside of videos series discussed in this article like:
- Learn Java - Dev.java
- Java Tutorial (w3schools.com)
- Java Tutorial - GeeksforGeeks
 
Web development
Many of the world's Java developers works with web and API though so it's a good idea to complement Java fundamentals knowledge with that of web development so looking into the following could be a good idea for your students:

JSP and Servlets, Web Development Using Java Technology For Beginners - GeeksforGeeks
Getting Started | Building a RESTful Web Service (spring.io)
JHipster - Full Stack Platform for the Modern Developer!
Get started with Java on Azure - Training | Microsoft Learn

 
Video series, Java for beginners
Here's a link to the the 23-part video series



 
Here's a selection of videos below from the 23-part series:
 
Maven. 
Maven is a so-called project management and comprehension tool. It allows you to build larger Java apps into projects that can use external libraries, produce something you can deploy and much more. Knowing Maven is a must if you build a bigger app. Gradle is another similar tool to Maven.



 
JShell
a read evaluate print loop for evaluating your code. A great thing for beginners to discover the language and its features.



 
Java testing
Learning to test your code is one of the first things you should know how to do as a developer. This video gives you insight on how you can get started with testing:]]></summary>

Spring Boot 3 is here (or will be tomorrow, on the 24th of November, 2022, to be more precise!), bringing a fantastic new Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation engine that supports GraalVM native images. Join me, and we’ll dive deep into the engine and its interactions with the Spring component model. 

This video is a detailed masterclass on the new AOT engine. It starts by examining the everyday usecases of an application developer and delves deeper and deeper into the engine, treating concerns that library and framework developers will care about. 

Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A picture showing .NET
What is .NET MAUI?
.NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) is a cross-platform framework for creating native mobile and desktop apps with C# and XAML. Using .NET MAUI, you can develop apps that can run on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows from a single shared code-base.
Using .NET MAUI, you can create multi-platform apps using a single project, but you can add platform-specific source code and resources if necessary. One of the key aims of .NET MAUI is to enable you to implement as much of your app logic and UI layout as possible in a single code-base.
 
In this blog, we will cover how to Build a Water Consumption Mobile App using .NET MAUI that consumes historical data from a Web API. This solution is part of a project build for .NET Conf Student Zone 2022
 
What will we be doing?
Before you can get started, we need a few things set up first:

Build a Mininal API from scratch to consume in your app
Build your first .NET MAUI App
Add a Consumption.cs class with the following propertiesA picture showing the Consumption.cs class
Add a APIManager.cs class to house the HTTP methods for your APIA picture showing the APIManager.cs class

After the above are added, you can start to:

Consume A Web API – this will show how you to consume the historical data stored in the Web API and display on your mobile app.
Send data to your Web API using the HTTP Post Method (shown in the link above too).

 
We have a dedicated Microsoft learn module that will show you how to Consume and Send Data to your Web API. All of the code for this part of the project and other parts are available on the .NET Student Zone Githup Repositry
 
To see and understand the how to implement this in Visual Studio you can watch my session below.

Finally, if you are curious about where the API data comes from, you can explore the other sessions of the .Net Student Conf and understand how all the different pieces and different technologies of .NET ecosystem are combined together into a single e-2-e project.]]></summary>

The validate-jwt policy is one of the most used policies within Azure API Management, will happily ensure your client applications are using the right client IDs, and have the right audiences and claims. Meanwhile, Azure Active Directory (AAD) is a mainstay of enterprise APIs, providing authentication and authorization controls for a wide variety of APIs from M365 APIs to custom-built APIs.  It's generally the center piece of your enterprise API security infrastructure.
 
Wouldn't it be wonderful if they worked better together.

This article describes how to get container level stats in Azure Blob Storage, and how to work with the information provided by blob inventory.
 
The approach presented here uses Azure Databricks and is most suited to be used in storage accounts with a huge amount of data.
 
At the end of this article, you would be able to create a script to calculate:

The total number of blobs in the container 
The total container capacity (in bytes)
The total number of snapshots in the container
The total container snapshots capacity (in bytes)
The total number of versions in the container

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GitHub is known as the most common DevOps platform to share ideas and collaborate on innovative solutions, but also deploy applications on the Cloud via tools like Visual Studio Code and build easy-to-navigate projects portfolios. In short terms, GitHub is known as the developer's best friend. 
As software and technologies continue to evolve, also Github platform and services are constantly evolving. In this blog post, I wish to show you how the latest Git tools, GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Copilot, can transform and support the world of education.
 
In the following video, you'll be listening about two stories, whose scenarios will be familiar to anyone who is studying or teaching at University, or simply anyone who ever learned a new programming language/framework or prepared a hands-on workshop to deliver. 
The first story's character is Ali, a Data Science teacher at the University of Nowhere. She is preparing for her spring semester course and in particular, she’s preparing a guided tutorial, with a full list of all the instructions her students will need to set up the environment for her Python lab.
The second story is about Mark. Mark is a student at University of Nowhere. He attended the Python data science lab by prof Ali and now he needs to complete the assignment at home. However, he gets stuck at some point.
 
How Github Codespaces and Github Copilot will help them and make their tasks easier? Watch the video below to find out the answer.

You will also know that in some cases the best thing to do is to restore your workload from an existing backup to meet your Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) requirements.  Many organizations have implemented processes to regularly create backups of their workloads, but - in a majority of the cases - we only see the recovery plan that is associated with these backups in action, when problems occur.  
 
In many cases it’s not the lack of an existing backup that complicates things, but rather an insufficient or untested recovery plan.

The good news is Azure Event Hub supplies multiple client sdks for us to use to serialize and deserialize payloads containing schema registry identifiers and avro-encoded data. In this section, I’d like to share how to use python sdk to send or receive events with schema registry in the Azure Event Hub mostly.

Many ISVs (Independent Software Vendors) are exchanging information with devices, applications, services, or humans. In many cases the information passed can be a file or a blob. Each of these ISVs would need to implement such a service. In the past few months, I discussed this capability with several (over 4) different customers, each with slightly unique needs. When I tried to generalize the need, it was clear: they wanted a quick, safe means to exchange files with customers or devices. 
 
So, I tried to translate these asks into user stories: 
 
As a service provider, I need my customers to upload content in a secure, easy-to-maintain micro-service exposed as an API (application programming interfaces) so that I can process the content uploaded and perform an action on it.

I really liked Python as a teaching language and as a first language for many students, due to its relatively low usage of punctuation and its tendency to read like an English sentence.
However, as it is a text-based language, there are still many frustrating ways to mess up a Python program – spelling things wrong, indenting incorrectly, not using the right function for the job, etc. – and new programmers can have a particularly hard time understanding how to fix incorrect code. Teachers and TAs can help students decipher errors, but we’re not always around when they’re coding, especially in large classes (my class size ranged from 1000-2000!).

Many enterprises use a schema registry for schema evolution use cases, such as the Confluent Schema Registry. Starting with version 1.1.x of Spring Cloud Stream until 3.0.0, we provided a schema registry server and AVRO-based schema registry client converters that can reconcile the schema from the schema registry server. Spring Cloud Stream version 3.0.0 moved the Schema Registry components into a top-level spring-cloud project, and Spring Cloud Stream included those in its BOM for the end user applications to consume them. However, this didn’t scale well, and with the 3.2 version, we decided to stop having them as part of the Spring Cloud Stream BOM.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Test driven development (TDD)
Test driven development, or TDD, is a method of directly coupling testing with every part of your daily development. Developers who use TDD typically start developing by first writing a test that fails, and then writing the code that makes the test pass. This approach means that product code is more likely to get high test coverage, and the tests typically come first.
 
Many developers find this pattern useful to help them prioritize good architecture from the start of development, and to stay laser-focused on each part of the functionality they need to implement. This school of thought advocates for testing not being an after-thought of development, but rather a driving force.
 
For example, in the following image, you can see that AddTest is written and fail…]]></summary>

I’ve been visiting with customers and talking to the community here in South East Asia. I was in Malaysia last week, and now I’m in Bangkok, Thailand. I’m near the end of my time here in SE Asia, which makes me sad. I’m dearly going to miss the food and the weather, but time waits for no person, and it’s almost time to go home.

And with time comes a jam-packed roster of new things we can read and learn from. So, without further ado, let’s dive right into it!

Both are best practice guidance around how to transform your organization to be cloud-centric (CAF) and how to build and manage cloud-hosted applications securely, cost-effectively, etc. (WAF).
 
But why are they important, and why should you, and your organization, use them on your cloud transformation journey?
 
Based on my experience of 30+ years in IT, including 10 years as CTO of DevOpsGroup (An Amdocs company) and 5yrs as a Microsoft Regional Director, I’ll give you 3 reasons:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Move app service resources across subscriptions
Many customers try to migrate across subscriptions, resource groups, and so on. Sometimes they use uploaded certificates in the App service instead of ASC.This blog will be helpful when they migrate App service resources with uploaded certificates. I wrote this blog for testing based on Azure docs.
 
See move across subscriptions 

 
Testing Steps
1. Prerequisites
2. Upload and bind certificates to App Service
3. Do the migration
4. Validate the result
 
1. Prerequisites
- App Service- App service domain: in my case, tlsmigrationtest.com- Add a custom domain to App Service: SSL isn't bound yet

 
2. Upload and bind certificates
Upload certificate (.pfx) and bind certificate to the app service domain.
A. App service > TLS/SSL settings > Private Key Certificates (.pfx) > Upload Certificate

 
B. Upload the certificate

C. Bind certificates
App Service > Custom domains > Add bindings

 
After finishing the above steps, you can see the SSL binding to the App Service domain.

 
3. Migration across subscriptions with uploaded certificates
A. For migration, go to your resource group.
 
B. Before moving resources you must click "show hidden types"
When you check "show hidden types", you can see uploaded certificates.

 
C. Check all App service resources and click move to another subscription
You must move all App Service resources together such as App Service, App service domain, and certificates.
Check limitation Move Azure App Service resources across resource groups or subscriptions - Azure Resource Manager | Microsoft Learn

 
D. Validate the result
Before you migrate app service resources, you can see the validation status.
If you can see succeeded status like below, you will be able to migrate successfully.

 
4. Success migration
Uploaded app service certificates are still bound to the App Service domain in the new subscription.]]></summary>

So you're building serverless applications with Microsoft Azure Functions, but you need to persist data to a database. What do you do about controlling the number of concurrent connections to your database from the function? What happens if the function currently connected to your database shuts down or a new instance comes online to scale with demand?
 
The concept of serverless in general, whether that be through a function or database, is great because it is designed for the modern application. Applications that scale on-demand reduce the maintenance overhead and applications that are pay as you go reduce unnecessary costs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many work apps need the ability to schedule a meeting with others in their organization. Here's how to do it for apps connected to Microsoft 365.
 
Work apps need work data
Work apps serve a specific purpose: they help you track projects, follow orders or manage resources. But rarely do they contain all the information that users need to complete their work. Typically, information about people, their calendars, or communication is stored elsewhere, like in Microsoft 365. And that's a shame because completing a task requires users to switch between different apps, which is detrimental to their productivity. Unless of course, you bring work data into your work app.
 
Find a meeting time and schedule a meeting on Microsoft 365
A common scenario for work apps is to schedule a meeting with others in the organization. While it sounds trivial, the app must be able to access attendees' calendars, find a suitable meeting time and schedule the meeting. And that's where Microsoft Graph comes in.
 
Recently I published an article on freeCodeCamp that shows you how to build an app connected to Microsoft 365 that can find a meeting time and schedule a meeting.
 

 
The app shows you how to make the best use of features available in the Microsoft Graph Toolkit and Microsoft Graph to build a UI that you could integrate with another app.
 
Want to learn more joing our 30 days of Graph challenge runs from November 1-30, 2022. Watch  this short YouTube video to find out why you should participate! 
 
Register for the 30 Days of Microsoft Graph Challenge today.
 
Check it out, and I'm looking forward to hearing what you think!]]></summary>

Impact



Users who have applied the mitigation should take note of the following impact:



No authorized scopes are mapped to the principal (current user) when the Authorization Server (AS) responds to the OAuth2 Access Token Response with an empty or missing scope parameter.



If you are affected by this vulnerability, users will not be granted any authorities beginning with SCOPE_ when the AS does not return scopes. Only the special authority ROLE_USER is given to the principal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure App Service on Linux images using PHP 8.x are now bundled with NGINX instead of Apache. The use of .htaccess files will not work for NGINX as these are used for Apache only. This will require the need to setup a custom startup script and modifying the existing NGINX site configuration.
 

 
Navigate to your App Service via the Azure Portal. Under the Development Tools section, select SSH then Go -->.
Modifying the default site config
You will want to make a copy of the existing configuration and place the file inside the /home/site directory.
 


cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /home/site/default


Once you created a default page as in the previous step, please update the location block to add HSTS Header and create the custom startup script as mentioned below
  
location / {           
index  index.php index.html index.htm hostingstart.html;
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
}
Creating the custom startup script
You will now need to create a custom startup script and save the file as /home/site/startup.sh



#!/bin/bash

cp /home/site/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
service nginx reload


In the custom startup script, we are doing the following:

Overriding the existing /etc/nginx/sites-available/default file with the /home/site/default file.
Reloading the NGINX service to make the updates take effect.

Updating the application settings
Navigate back to your App Service via the Azure Portal. Under the Settings section, select Configuration.
Go over to the General Settings section of the Configuration blade.
For the Startup Command enter the following: /home/site/startup.sh
Save these settings and navigate to your application https://{sitename}.azurewebsites.net/

Many companies rely on SAP S/4HANA and an assortment of custom applications, SaaS services, or other commercial solutions to run their business functions. Given this diverse deployment topology, they require their SAP S/4HANA applications to work together with other applications that run on Azure.  A way to achieve this is by integrating both systems using an event-driven approach. You can now configure your SAP Event Mesh (SAP’s event broker) to send SAP events to Azure Event Grid more easily than current alternative approaches. This way, your applications on Azure can react to system state changes that originate in an SAP backend application.

Immutable vaults protect your backups by blocking any operations that could lead to loss of recovery points if misused. Further, you can lock the immutability setting to make it irreversible, which can prevent malicious actors from disabling immutability and deleting backups.
Immutability is supported for Recovery Services vaults as well as Backup vaults.
How it works
Backup data stored using Azure Backup is not accessible directly and the only way to access or manage this data is through the vault. Immutable vaults help you by preventing any operations that, if used by malicious actors, could lead to the loss of back…]]></summary>
