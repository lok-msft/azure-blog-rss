Microsoft and CAST partner together to automate migration and modernization of custom applications with Azure Migrate and CAST used together, under the Azure Migrate & Modernize Program, complementing the current Azure tooling capabilities.
 
In the past decade, organizations have been engaged in migrating their applications to clouds. Some of the in-house custom applications have been moved through simple “Lift & Shift” motions (Rehost) to quickly reach cloud and leverage some of its benefits, mostly at infrastructure level, example, in performance or resilience.
 
While shifted to cloud, these applications may not make best use from all cloud services – example, cope…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! How are you? This week I’m writing you from sunny Seattle, Washington, where we’re having our next installment of the SpringOne Tour series. It’s been a ton of fun seeing all these fun and friendly faces again and getting to see people, many of whom I haven’t seen since before the pandemic! I’ve also had a lot of fun seeing some friends from some of the big cloud companies here, Microsoft and AWS. It’s always interesting to learn how people are using the latest and greatest from Spring to build amazing systems and software targeting these cloud platforms.

We’ve got a lot to cover this week so let’s dive right into it!


  
In last week’s podcast, I talked to Kubernetes contributor and fellow Tanzu Developer Advocate Leigh Capili

  
Distributed Tracing With OpenTelemetry, Spring Cloud Sleuth, Kafka, and Jaeger

  
Ingress vs. Load Balancer in Kubernetes

  
Instantiating Multiple Beans of the Same Class with Spring Annotations

  
Curious about when and why to use Java 14 Records vs. Lombok? Check out this article

  
I put together this little example , thanks to Reactor lead Simon Baslé, showing how to handle pagination with the expand operator in Project Reactor: Pagination in a Reactive Application. It looks at how to eleganrly expand the contents of a reactive stream as new data (in a data pagination scenario) becomes available.

  
Spring Shell 2.1.0-RC1 is now available

  
Pushing a Docker Image to a Self-Hosted Registry

  
Spring for Apache Kafka 2.9 Release Candidate Available

  
This Apache Maven Survival Guide is quite interesting, to me at least!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the main missing pieces for the Compose spec support in az containerapp compose was support for the build key.
 
With the 0.2.0 release, there is now support for the build key.  The container image build is handled by Azure Container Registry, so you can either provide ACR credentials or a new container registry will be created for you as part of the creation process.  Only context and dockerfile are currently supported.  
 
Example Compose File for a .NET Web Api project:
 
 
 
 
version: '3'
services:
  api:
    build:
      context: ./src
      dockerfile: ./TodoApi/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 8080:80
 
 
 
 
Example Repository Layout:
 

 
Example Command:
 
 
 
cd dotnet_api
az group create --name dotnet_api_example --location eastus
az containerapp compose create \
            --environment dotnetaca \
            --resource-group dotnet_api_example

Log Analytics is a powerful tool to query your logs and gain insights from the abundance of data stored in them.
Sometimes, getting started with a query might be a challenge - especially for new users who are not yet familiar with our data structure and are not yet KQL fluent.
To assist users with their first steps in log exploration, we've introduced several tools, including built-in Example Queries and Query Packs, both designed to allow users to start their exploration with pre-built, curated queries.
Today we are happy to introduce another powerful way to start your log exploration - Find In Table.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am pleased to announce that the release candidate Spring for Apache Kafka 2.9.0 is now available (2.9.0-RC1) in the Spring Milestone Repo.



This version is not provided by Spring Boot dependency management, but it can be used with Boot 2.7, as long as you override the Kafka dependencies as described in this appendix, especially if you are using the embedded Kafka broker.



Notable Changes




This version uses the 3.2.0 kafka-clients version



Non-blocking retry bootstrapping is now more robust



New Error Handler Mode





By default, after an error, the DefaultErrorHandler performs seeks on the remaining records from the last poll and re-fetches them from the broker on the next poll.
With high error rates and large max.poll.records, this can cause unnecessary strain on the network.
For this reason, the error handler has a new property seekAfterError, when set to false, instead of seeking the records, the remaining records are retained in memory and the consumer paused for the next poll (or multiple polls if the error handler is configured to use the ContainerPausingBackOffHandler).





Pausing Containers





By default, when you pause() a container, it actually pauses when all the records from the previous poll have been processed.
This version adds the pauseImmediate container property, which, when true, causes the container to pause after the current record is processed.



For information about all changes in this release, see What’s New.

What we will try to make smoother is the testability part.
 
Let me take a step back here and explain. The built-in policies are great as a user-friendly way for implementing simple authentication use cases. A couple of clicks in the Azure Portal to create a policy, test it in the Portal as well, and send off a couple of parameters to the dev team to inject in their code and that's it. In theory.

I only just realized it was Tuesday! And you know what that means? It’s time for our weekly dive into the wild and wonderful world of Springdom!

How do architects define and think about Chaos Engineering? 
Chaos engineering is that part of application development in which you try to excise uncertainty about specific failure conditions that might happen with the system or its components. Many architects just guess what's going to happen if there's a failure condition, and in many instances, they don't even like to think about it.

Azure Functions are great for running tasks on demand, like processing queue messages or resizing images. They can run serverless, which means that you can run them without having to configure and maintain infrastructure. And with Azure DevOps Pipelines, Microsofts' Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) solution, you can easily compile your Azure Functions and deploy to the Azure.
In this post, we'll take a look at how we can use Azure DevOps Pipelines to easily build and deploy an Azure Function to the cloud.

Overview
 
Azure Functions is a Serverless component from Microsoft that allows you to create event-based functions that can be dynamically scaled to meet the demand. We can work with all kinds of events such as when a file is uploaded to storage, a message appears in the queue or a HTTP request is received.
 
Using GitHub we can take an existing application, fork it to our account and then create our own version of the application, all from within VS Code.
 
What's covered in this lab

A simple way to run containers in Azure
 
Containers offer a great way to develop and run applications in a consistent environment. You can develop your app in a container on your local development machine, and run that same container in production, thereby eliminating differences in infrastructure between environments. And now, you can easily run containers in Azure with Azure Container Apps. Azure Container Apps abstracts the overhead of infrastructure and orchestration, making it easy for you to deploy and run a container.
In this post, we'll deploy a sample container to Azure Container Apps.

Application performance testing
 
When you build an application, you want it to be fast. Users should perceive it as fast and performant, even when many users are using it. And your application should continue to work without errors when it is under load. It can be difficult to know how your application behaves when it is used by many concurrent users. Azure Load Testing can help by putting your application under load and analyzing how it performs.
In this post, we'll test the performance of an existing web application with Azure Load Testing.
 
Prerequisites

This post is intended to provide you with a path to using dedicated hosts with AVD, and will walk through a portal-based deployment, that we will update to use dedicated hosts.

Provisioning the VMs in your AVD pool will be similar to other portal-based deployment, but with attention paid to the availability options.

Serverless Stream processing is increasingly becoming a vital part of complex distributed systems. An event streaming platform like Kafka is capable of handling trillions of events, manipulates data as it arrives, supports publishing of data to any number of systems or real-time applications running in distributed systems.

It is very important to keep secrets and settings out of source code to make sure that they can be changed easily and can be secured. A good way to do that, is to store your secrets and settings in a central service. Azure provides a service like that, and it's called Azure App Configuration.
Azure App Configuration can store secrets and settings for you in a central place, so that your application doesn't have to store them in source code. On top of that, it has the ability to manage feature flags. These are settings that you use in your application to enable or disable features, like a new menu-item that is only visible when the feature flag 'beta' is enabled. This allows you to deploy changes to production, and only ma…]]></summary>

Frontend web applications often rely on dynamic content retrieved from APIs. Azure Static Web Apps supports seamless integration with Azure Functions to create serverless HTTP APIs. Azure Functions is one of several popular options for hosting APIs on Azure. Today, we’re excited to announce Azure Static Web Apps has added preview support for integrating APIs in the following Azure services:
 

Azure App Service – host APIs built with frameworks like Flask, Express, Apollo, and ASP.NET
Azure Container Apps – integrate with APIs and microservices running in serverless containers
Azure API Management – aggregate multiple APIs in a unified API gateway

Automated deployments create better software
When you need to manually build and deploy your app, each time that you make a change, you will make mistakes, which result in bugs and downtime for users. Automating your build and deployment processes makes them less error-prone and allows you to deploy as often as you want. GitHub Actions can help to automate your builds and deployments and integrates with Azure App Service.
 
In this post, we'll automatically build and deploy code to an Azure App Service using GitHub Actions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! How are you? It’s been a hot minute since we last chatted. I was in Germany this time last week. Now, I’m back in beautiful San Francisco. Today the weather will climb to a monumental 84 F! That’s very unusual, for any time of the year, here in San Francisco. Most places here in San Francisco don’t have air conditioning. Some have heating. I bought a brand new condo in 2014 and it didn’t have air conditioning. You just open the window. I am privileged enough that I have air conditioning today, of course. I mention all this to say that it’s hot here! I worry for the elderly! When it gets this hot, the YMCA and other organizations typically invite elderly people to come in and get some cool air and water. It’s dangerous. Some days it gets even hotter. Very rare, but it does happen. I hope you’re all doing well. Take care of yourselves and each other, my friends. 

And, speaking of being hot, let’s look at this week’s roundup of the latest-and-greatest that’s hot off the press!

If this is your first time learning about Azure Durable Functions, I definitely recommend reading through the Durable Functions overview content first.

Since the launch of guest configuration in 2018, the product has been a key piece of many Azure security and Azure governance scenarios. The service enables customers to audit and report on configuration settings inside machines, at cloud scale. This past year, we have been working to support customers more holistically, shipping the public preview of  “Apply and Monitor” and “Apply and Autocorrect” assignment types, and are working hard on the upcoming GA of these capabilities.
 
We have been listening to our customers as well as the community and are excited to announce a name that highlights the current and future capabilities of our service. Guest configuration will become machine configuration. In addition to the name change, we are moving under the Automanage brand umbrella to reinforce the message that the goal of machine configuration is to reduce op-ex and customer burden in managing their Windows and Linux machines both in Azure and on-premises. It is important to note that the current experience within policy will not change. Customers will still be able to apply machine configurations at scale through policy assignments as they have thus far. 
 
This rebranding will go live soon in the Azure portal as well as our documentation. More information to come soon about the GA of our enforcement capabilities.]]></summary>

When the built-in user flows don't cut it you have to create custom policies based on XML, but it has been a somewhat bumpy ride getting the custom policies you craft uploaded to Azure. In the beginning you could only do it through the Azure Portal which made for a manual and error-prone deployment process. After a couple of interim improvements along the way we have eventually gotten to where it's possible to have an Azure DevOps based pipeline setup  invoking REST APIs to get the policies into the right place. It's not perfect though so I thought I'd take a crack at improving further upon this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In May, dynamic concurrency(denoted as DC in this blog) in Azure Functions became generally available. By enabling dynamic concurrency, the platform can adjust the concurrency of functions dynamically in the condition that the worker instance is healthy(like CPU and thread utilization is healthy). You can refer to more information about dynamic concurrency in this link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-concurrency#dynamic-concurrency.
 
In this blog, I am writing to introduce how DC works in Azure function apps with some tests.
 
How to enable Dynamic Concurrency?
By default, dynamic concurrency is disabled. With dynamic concurrency enabled, concurrency starts at 1 for each function, and is adjusted up to an optimal value, which is determined by the host.

Shortly after, Christian Dupuis joined, led the project for many years and initiated the Spring Tool Suite on top of Spring IDE.

It’s been a long time since then.

On December 4 of 2017, a new chapter for the Spring tooling began with the introduction of the all-new Spring Tools 4 and its first public beta release, followed by the first GA releas…]]></summary>

I’ve just arrived in beautiful Berlin, Germany, for the forthcoming We Are Developers show with more than five thousand attendees. I was in Toronto, Canada, for the epic SpringOne Tour installment there. I’ve also had the privilege of taking these last two trips with my daughter, Kimly. She’s on summer break from school. It’s made the long miserable hours in economy bearable, and something for which I couldn’t be more grateful. I’m also looking forward to being at the upcoming SpringOne Tour installment in New York City, later this month. Don’t miss it! 

In the meantime, we’ve got a ton of good stuff to get to this week so let’s dive right in!

Therefore, you should follow an authentication and authorisation process to use the API unless it's the public API. Those authentication/authorisation process uses either 1) an auth key or 2) an access token through an OAuth process.
 
Using the auth key approach, you can store it in a safe place like the Azure Key Vault service and fetch the key. It's a relatively simple process. However, if you need to use the OAuth process, it gets complicated with the following authorisation process. Here's the conceptual OAuth process.

What is APIM Authorizations
Before we dive into creating the application, let's quickly look at what this feature is.
 
In a connected system, being able to communicate between different Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms is a common task, but often these platforms will use OAuth2 to verify the user identity. This requires undertaking an authentication flow, which is fine if you're directly using the system, but what if it's being handled by a background job, like an Azure Function running with a Timer Trigger?

The first thing to point out in this landscape is that there are two distinct scenarios: brownfield and greenfield. Anytime you’re building something new, such as a factory, building or car, and you want to include Internet connected devices or components, you are working within a greenfield scenario. Anytime you want to connect existing devices and assets that may have been around for years to decades, this typically is a brownfield scenario.  The assets or devices were not designed to be network or internet connected by default.

Getting started with Azure Load Testing has never been easier. You can now create a test without prior knowledge of testing tools by entering a URL on the Azure portal. You can set up, run, and test a URL in less than 5 minutes.
 
Run a quick test

Create an Azure Load Testing resource. You can use an existing resource if you have one.
Once it is created, navigate to the resource overview page.
In the Get started tab, click on Quick test.
Enter the URL you want to test.
Optionally, you can change any of the load parameters like number of virtual users, test duration, and ramp-up time.
Click on Run test.

To try out it out, install durable-functions v2.x from npm. 
 
Note: This is a breaking change release, so make sure to check that your applications are not affected by any of the modified APIs. That said, we have only changed edge-case behaviors that we believe should not affect most apps. 
 
Durable Functions (DF) makes it easy to implement robust stateful services that make full use of the scaling and billing benefits of serverless, all while using your language of choice: C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and PowerShell.

There are different types of solutions and places where you can host AI models, filtering models, database components, all for the purpose of doing things in the premises world before they actually connect to the cloud and send data to the cloud.

The thing about retaining logs is that the storage requirements can get big. REALLY big.
 
One of the most common log search and indexing tools is ElasticSearch. ElasticSearch is exceptionally good at finding a needle in the haystack (e.g. When did the string "Error message #123" occur in any copy of application X on March 17th). It does this by indexing the contents of the log message which can significantly increase your storage consumption.

Azure Static Web Apps is a service that's perfect for your full stack as well as static files projects. Yes, you heard that correctly. Regardless if you are dealing with:

A static resume site
SPA application
Static site generator like Gatsby etc

Azure Static Web Apps is there for you and enables you to deploy your files to Azure.

how does that work?

When you create an Azure resource, it connects your GitHub repo to Azure via workflow file in yaml. This ensures that all your future work can be pushed to Azure with nothing but Git and GitHub.

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/static/

Sounds like it's worth trying? If, so have a look at these resources

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-static-web-apps/
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview

What is Azure Static Web Apps CLI?
It's a CLI you run from your console. With it, you can do a lot of things like the below:

Work on your JAMstack app locally
Built-in framework detection
Serverless support
Authentication & Authorization
Login to Azure
Deploy & Ship from the CLI
New documentation site

Check it out, how it can accelerate your workflow building SWA apps :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since 2019, we’ve expanded the capabilities of Azure Spring Cloud, including the Enterprise tier we announced in preview at SpringOne in 2021.  Azure Spring Cloud is a fully featured platform for all types of Spring applications, and to better reflect this we’re now calling the service Azure Spring Apps. 
 
We’ve created new versions for Azure CLI, as well as new plugins for Maven, IntelliJ and VS Code. Existing versions will continue to operate in deprecation mode.  
You’ll see this change is already reflected in the Azure portal, Azure CLI, API, Azure marketplace, and VMware Tanzu product descriptions.  The name has already been updated in Microsoft Docs, but you will continue to see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams. 
Changes in the Azure billing meter description, Powershell, Github actions, Azure DevOps task and Nubesgen will take place in upcoming weeks.  
As introducing the name change in Terraform unavoidably interrupts existing behavior, we’re still in the process of evaluating whether we’ll change the name in Terraform.  
 
Action recommended 

Upgrade to the new version of Azure CLI with
az extension add -n spring
You can optionally remove the old extension using 
az extension remove -n spring-cloud 

Upgrade plugins for Maven , IntelliJ and VS Code.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Event Hubs enables you to stream millions of events per second from any source using Kafka, AMQP or HTTPS protocols. Using Event Hubs capture feature, you can load real-time streaming data to data lakes, warehouses, and other storage services, so that they can be processed or analyzed by analytics services. 
 
Today we are excited to announce the preview of Apache Parquet capturing support in Azure Event Hubs. 
 
Why Apache Parquet for big data analytics?
Apache Parquet is column-oriented storage format that is designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. It’s open source and is not tied to any processing framework, data model or programming language. Parquet is ideal for storing any kind of big data and is built to support efficient compression and encoding schemes.  
 
Capture streaming data in Parquet format using Event Hubs
Using Azure Event Hubs, no code editor for event processing, you can automatically capture streaming data in an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account in Parquet format. The no code editor allows you to easily develop an Azure Stream Analytics job without writing a single line of code.
 

Once data is captured, any analytics service of your choice can process or analyze Parquet data. 
 
Get Started Today
You can try out Apache Parquet capturing feature in Azure Event Hubs using the following links.

To try out Parquet capturing feature, follow Capture data from Event Hubs in Parquet format.
You can follow the tutorial on Capture Event Hubs data in Parquet format and analyze with Azure Synapse Analytics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Monitor provides a rich set of enterprise ready capabilities to ensure you have complete observability of your hybrid environment, helping you keep it always available, reliable and performant. We announced several new capabilities at Microsoft Build 2022 to help you gain intelligent and streamlined visibility into your apps and container workloads.
 
Intelligently view and identify root causes in application map with Application Insights

We have introduced an Intelligent view toggle on the application map feature that uses patented AIOps and machine learning models to guide you to the root cause of the issue being investigated. The map now can recommend the exact node to node edges that need further investigation.The images below illustrate this benefit:
 


Easily enable Application Insights for client-side monitoring of Node.js apps

We have introduced JavaScript auto-injection to Application Insights Node.js SDK that now simplifies enablement for client side monitoring.

 
Streamline your query experience from Container Insights

Our new ContainerLogv2 schema offers a streamlined querying experience by reducing your data to a single table as well as the number of required join operations.

 
We also recently introduced a public preview of Azure Managed Grafana and new Grafana integrations, with the ability to pin Azure Monitor visualizations from Azure Portal to Grafana and new out-of-the-box monitoring dashboards.
 
Learn more about Azure Monitor and monitoring best practices for your cloud and edge environments with our dedicated guidance cookbooks. We welcome you to reach out to us with any questions or feedback on our Tech Community.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[REST APIs have been with us for over 20 years now.  In that time, our expectations of client applications have grown.  We expect client applications to run on mobile devices with low bandwidth, yet still be responsive.  Unfortunately, REST APIs restrict us in three basic ways:

It takes too many requests to fulfill the data needs for a single page.
The REST API returns too much data for the page being rendered.
The client application needs to poll to get new information.

There have been various attempts to solve these issues, and the current favorite is GraphQL.  GraphQL is a protocol specification that explicitly solves these issues.  The client application can specify the data they need to render a page in a query document that is sent as a single request to the GraphQL service.  A clie…]]></summary>

Azure Arc provides a simplified Governance and Management capability by delivering a consistent multi-cloud and on-premises management platform. Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes allows us to on-board and manage Kubernetes clusters running anywhere - clusters running on other public cloud providers (GCP or AWS) or clusters running on on-premise data-centers (VMware vSphere or Azure Stack HCI) to Azure Arc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Log Analytics is introducing a new way to view and manage Table metadata from the Azure Portal. With this new experience our customers can view and edit table properties directly from Azure Portal->Log Analytics workspaces. Up until now, this was only possible using the Tables REST API or CLI.
 
In this blog you will learn how to manage each table’s plan and retention and archiving policy using the Azure Portal's Tables experience - which was lately introduced in preview.
 
From the Log Analytics workspaces menu, select Tables (preview).
The Tables screen lists all the tables in the workspace with their properties:

Type: Azure table \ Custom table \ Search results \ Restored logs
Plan: Analytics \ Basic
Retention properties:

Interactive retention
Archive period
Total retention period




 
To edit a specific table setting, select the context menu of the table you want to configure and select Manage table.

 
From the table’s configuration screen you can:

Edit the table’s Plan.By default, all tables in your workspace are Analytics tables. You can configure particular tables to use Basic Logs. The list of tables that are applicable to Basic plan can be found here. You can read here about the differences between Analytics and Basic Logs plans.
Configure the retention and archive duration in Data retention settings section.By default, all tables in your workspace inherit the workspace retention and have no archive. From the Data retention settings section you can set the retention policies for individual tables: Interactive retention and Total retention, and the Archive retention value is calculated as (Total – Interactive).
Note: 
Selecting a longer retention period will incur additional charges. For more information see our pricing page.Selecting a shorter retention period may result in some data loss.]]></summary>

Last month, I wrote about how work items in Azure DevOps can be automatically created as you receive alerts from Azure (Microsoft Sentinel Alerts and Incidents & Microsoft Defender for Cloud Alerts, Recommendations and Compliance Assessments).
In this post, I'm sharing how you can

Create a webhook that will close/dismiss the Azure alert/incident as you resolve the work item (State = Resolved/Closed), and
Reactivate the Azure alert/incident when the work item reopens (State != Resolved/Closed)

Solution Idea
Here's the high level diagram for this solution, see here for the logic app code.

To maximize their success on the platform, they need to continuously review their operational procedures to minimize maintenance and management overhead.
To achieve this, each individual team needs to focus on high-business value activities instead of spending time on undifferentiated tasks like manual testing, manual build and deployment, or others.
No matter what type of workload; be it a conventional lift-and-shift or a highly distributed cloud native application: In the cloud we can no longer avoid all failure – like we sometimes attempted to in a traditional on-premises scenario.

Because while Azure App Services, which we have covered in previous parts, are nice and dandy they simply don't serve all your microservice needs.
 
AKS is kind of a double feature when it comes to going credless:

The first is what we've been doing up until now. The provisioning and configuration of the cluster is handled by a GitHub Action which is trusted by Azure through using a federated credential.
The second is that Kubernetes is a system of its own and part of that is having a credential and identity model inside the cluster regardless of Azure. This can in turn be configured to have Azure trust the cluster and create a bridge between…]]></summary>

The symptom might include that after restarting the web app for a few hours, a percentage of the total requests (e.g. 1/3) get no response from the web server and timeout after 230 seconds. 230 seconds is the Azure default timeout value. The web app's memory usage may be observed to grow continuously since the issue starts.

Azure Container Apps is a modern, fully-managed, serverless platform for running containers. While we don't have to manage infrastructure, it's still up to us to figure out how to build our container image and deploy it.
 
Today, we're introducing a preview feature in the Azure CLI that streamlines the process of deploying to Azure Container Apps in a single command. Whether your source code is on your local machine or in GitHub, "az containerapp up" is the only command you need to get your app running in Azure Container Apps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At Azure Event Hubs we are upgrading our infrastructure to the newest technologies, allowing us to use the latest features available. Due to this infrastructure change, the IP-addresses associated with our customers’ namespaces are also going to change.
 
Your Event Hubs based solutions may break if you are not following the best practices of using service tags or domain names in your firewall or network devices configurations to allow communication with this service but are instead using these IP-addresses.
 
If you are using Event Hubs basic, standard or dedicated, we recommend using  service tags, as per our recommendations described in the service documentation. Service tags will automatically be updated if anything changes in our infrastructure, meaning you won’t have to make these changes manually. If you are not able to use service tags, we recommend using the fully qualified domain names for your specific namespaces or the general “*.servicebus.windows.net” domains. These will automatically resolve to the new configurations as well, meaning you won’t be impacted by these changes either.
 
 If you are using Event Hubs premium, you are not impacted from this infrastructure upgrade.
 
As we are moving forward with implementing these changes, we will be updating this blogpost with the impacted regions and their new IP ranges. Below you can find the impacted regions that we have currently planned.

First, what is GitOps? Is it the same as DevOps? I'm so glad you asked. Let's begin with a refresher on what DevOps is:
 
"DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable the continuous delivery of value to our end users." ~ Donovan Brown
 
Donovan puts it best - DevOps is a combination of several key factors: people, process, and products - but it starts with people. Getting started with DevOps involves a cultural shift, which means it's so much more than buzz words like agile, continuous integration, continuous deployment, automation, etc. While those buzz words have their place and are needed, truly embracing DevOps means creating a DevOps culture between your engineering teams - this includes developers, operations, security, and beyond.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Communication between a client application and an Azure Service Bus namespace is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS is a standard cryptographic protocol that ensures privacy and data integrity between clients and services over the Internet. For more information about TLS, see Transport Layer Security.
Azure Service Bus supports choosing a specific TLS version for namespaces. Currently Azure Service Bus uses TLS 1.2 on public endpoints by default, but TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are still supported for backward compatibility.
Azure Service Bus namespaces permit clients to send and receive data with TLS 1.0 and above. To enforce stricter security measures, you can configure your Service Bus namespace to require that clients send and receive data with a newer version of TLS. If a Service Bus namespace requires a minimum version of TLS, then any requests made with an older version will fail.
To learn more, see Enforce a minimum required version of Transport Layer Security (TLS) for requests to a Service Bus namespace.]]></summary>

Azure Spring Cloud platform provides AppPlatformIngressLogs to query Ingress request log for those Apps with endpoint enabled.
But for the Apps with endpoint disabled, since the traffic is not going through the platform load balancer, the ingress request log is not recorded. For such cases, to monitor the App access log, we can use Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools like Application Insights.
 
In this blog, let's demonstrate how to use AppPlatformIngressLogs and Application Insights to monitor both types of request access log.

Abstract
In this article, we describe how to protect a multi-tier application with multiple components (like Magento, now Adobe Commerce ) on Azure Kubernetes Service against disasters like the complete loss of a region with NetApp® Astra™ Control Service. We demonstrate how the use of pre-snapshot execution hooks in Astra Control Service enables us to create application-consistent snapshots and backups across all application tiers and recover the application to a different region in case of a disaster.

What exactly is a mission-critical application or workload?
 
Well, it means you're building an app on Azure. And a workload is just a bunch of services, technologies, and resources that support a unified business goal or solution, that meets your needs. You'll usually string together many services, APIs, and data to get the final functionality you're after. Some people might call this a solution instead. Just for clarity, an architecture is when we really dig into how we put together the given solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[App Service Windows includes multiple versions of Tomcat. Sometimes, you may want to add custom configurations via web.xml file.
 
Before talking about how to change web.xml file in App Service windows, let's discuss "what is web.xml"?
 
Java web applications use a deployment descriptor file to determine how URLs map to servlets, which URLs require authentication, and other information. This file is named web.xml and resides in the app's WAR under the WEB-INF/ directory. web.xml is part of the servlet standard for web applications.
 
The default Servlet configurations is under ${catalina.home}/conf. For each webapp, the settings could be found under ${catalina.home}/webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF.
 
When tomcat deploys the application, it reads the generic configurations from conf/web.xml and then WEB-INF/web.xml in the web application. 
 
It instructs the Tomcat which classes to load, what parameters to set in the context, and how to intercept requests coming from browsers.
There you specify:

what servlets (and filters) you want to use and what URLs you want to map them to
listeners - classes that are notified when some events happen (context starts, session created, etc)
configuration parameters (context-params)
error pages, welcome files
security constraints

Back to our topic, if you haven't defined a custom error page, you will the default page as below:

 
To add a custom error page, please follow below steps:

Add <error-page></error-page> in web.xml under webapps/ROOT/WEB_INF. For example, my custom error page "error.html" is under root folder /webapp, so I should use "/error.html" in <location></location>.



Add your custom error in webapps folder.



Build and re-deploy the project to App Service.
Now you will see the custom error page replace the default one.


 
Please kindly note, configurations won't take effect if you add web.xml directly in Kudu site. Tomcats only reads the configurations from war file during startup.]]></summary>

The App Service VNet integration feature enables your apps to access resources in or through a virtual network but doesn't grant inbound private access to your apps. For inbound access, you need private endpoints, which allow clients located in your private network to securely access your apps over Private Link, which eliminates exposure from the public internet.
 
With this update, you can use our lower-cost tiers and achieve the same level of security that you could previously only achieve with our high-end SKUs. Note that if you want to downgrade an existing App Service Plan and still use VNet integration, you need to be on the newer App Service footprint to ensure you’re App Service Plan supports VNet integration for Basic SKU. For more details, see the VNet integration limitations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
Azure API Management is a hybrid, multi-cloud management service for APIs onAzure; ensuring a complete abstraction of backend APIs and its complexities from the consumer of the APIs. This allows API developers to Securely expose APIs to various types of API consumers with varying degree of access control, observability and protection mechanisms available out-of-the-box.
 
Azure API Management has deep integrations with Azure AD which in turn has support for with the OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect through Microsoft identity platform. These two powerful, feature-rich resources can be leveraged to secure backend APIs without adding any code or logic within the APIs itself; thus making the Security of APIs clean, flexible and reusable

Solution Architecture
 
Let's say you're building a microservices architecture. It typically consists of an API gateway and many API apps, which are Azure API Management (APIM) and Azure Functions API in this example. The microservices architecture might be more complex depending on the requirements, but it's way too far from our topic. Therefore, let's build a minimal structure that is working.

As you might know, APIM comes with Developer, Consumption, Basic, Standard, Premium tiers. Microsoft also refers to an Isolated (in preview) tier on its pricing page but I do not know what's behind, so let's stick to the other tiers with the exception of the Consumption tier, which I will park since there is nothing to consider network-wise, other than the fact that it has no instance-specific IPs that you can contro…]]></summary>

The SCM site is the engine behind App Service for deployment, meaning that the release pipeline of Azure DevOps deploys code to the SCM site of an app. In most scenario, SCM site can be reached through public internet. Therefore, ensuring secure access to the site becomes more important. We can enable access restriction on SCM site or set up other firewall solutions to control incoming traffic to the site.

Here we will introduce you on how to identify and whitelist deployment traffic from Azure pipeline to SCM site with access restriction. This article also applies when setting up the same rules in other firewall solutions.

"What if we can provision Azure Static Web App and deploy the app at the same time? If we can, we just simply hand over our PoC repository to developers so that they just run it directly from there."

 
Although two challenges exist to achieve this idea, if we can combine both challenges, devs can autopilot everything from the resource creating to the app deployment, which will result in improving the development experiences. Throughout this post, I'm going to discuss how to offer the autopilot feature for your application repository.

Detecting performance issues in today’s applications and web services can be challenging. Even with the right profiling tools and an abundance of profiler data, it can be hard for developers to efficiently uncover useful insights. For instance, manually sifting through gigabytes of profiler data can be tedious and time consuming.
 
One of the common ways to address performance issues is to scale out cloud resources. While it may feel like a reasonable solution in the short run, the resulting costs can add up over time and even cause problems such as cloud sprawling, which can be a maintenance nightmare.

A few weeks back, a customer asked us for a way to effectively track the alerts that they get from Microsoft Sentinel and Defender for Cloud and ensure resolution. For organisations with an ITIL practice, this work is tracked by logging an Incident or a Problem ticket in an ITSM tool. But some organisations are a lot leaner (no ITIL practice and no ITSM tooling) and simply need something that works.
 
Solution Idea
And so the idea is to use Azure Boards as a simple Kanban board for the operations team to track work status. The tasks are created automatically as alerts/incidents are raised using Azure Logic Apps.
 
Workflow
But before that, let's design the workflow:

 
This workflow is implemented using a custom inherited process in Azure Boards. In our implementation, we used

There are many reasons why customers consider migrating their existing on-premises big data workloads to Azure.

Cost of ownership -  Running a cluster of computers in an on-premises data center requires a considerable administration effort, as well as consuming significant capital expenditure on hardware. Day-to-day running costs involved in maintaining a cool and stable environment for high-powered computing resources can also be a significant factor.
Uncertainty in on-premises ecosystem - In the past few years, Hadoop on Cloud has significantly helped shape the on-premises Hadoop ecosystem.

Authored by Vikram Bansal, Senior PM, Azure Migrate
 
Migrating a large & complex IT environment from on-premises to the cloud can be quite daunting. Customers are often challenged with the problem of unknown where they may not have complete visibility of applications running on their servers or the dependencies between them, as they start planning their migration to cloud. This results not only in leaving behind dependent servers causing the application to break, but also adds up to the migration cost that the customers want to reduce. Azure Migrate aims at helping customers build a high-confidence migration plan with features like software inventory and agentless dependency …]]></summary>

We received some query from the users about how the Key Vault Reference worked on the ASE V3 platform, in order to help users to have a better understanding on this, I write this article.

What and why Mock APIs
To mock something means you respond with fake data, that data can be in-memory, from a file or some kind of tool generating a bunch of endpoints. There are some reasons why mocking an API could be a good idea:

Different teams work at different speeds. Let's say your app is built by two different teams, or developers and one is faster than the other. That's when it's handy to rely on a mocked API.
You start with the frontend first. Your team/developer have decided to build a full vertical and starts with the frontend and slowly work their way towards the backend and the data source.

Ok, so we established there might be a need to mock your API. So how do we do it? Yo…]]></summary>

However, Azure Cache for Redis, remained on TLS certificates issued by the Baltimore CyberTrust Root. Because the current Baltimore CyberTrust Root will expire in May 2025, now is the time for Azure Cache for Redis to switch to the DigiCert Global G2 CA Root*. The migration will start in May 2022, and finish by the end of June 2022.

What I realized when testing out stuff was that while I did use my own blog post for reference it was sort of unpractical scrolling up and down the page to find the right command, and jumping between various tools and ways of solving things. I thought that "hey, wouldn't it be nice if I could just start a script and have it go through everything automatically?"
