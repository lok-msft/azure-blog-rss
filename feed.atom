If you're running distributed applications on JBoss EAP, you know that clustering is essential for data consistency and fault tolerance. We've taken this a step further on Azure App Service. Now, when you integrate JBoss EAP with an Azure Virtual Network (VNet), clustering isn't just an option; it's a built-in feature that kicks in automatically. 
 
What does this mean for your apps? For starters, it improves fault tolerance and enables more efficient data sharing across multiple instances. Your application can now handle traffic spikes and server failures better. The service scales based on your configured settings in Azure App Service, providing both vertical and horizontal options.

This programming model is part of Azure Functions’ larger effort to provide a more flexible and intuitive experience for all supported languages. You may be aware that we announced General Availability of the new Python programming model for Azure Functions at MS Build this year. The new Node.js experience we ship today is a result of the valuable feedback we received from JavaScript and TypeScript developers through GitHub, surveys, user studies, as well as suggestions from internal Node.js experts working closely with customers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are thrilled to announce the general availability of DenyAction, a new effect in Azure Policy! With the introduction of Deny Action, policy enforcement now expands into blocking request based on actions to the resource. These deny action policy assignments can safeguard critical infrastructure by blocking unwarranted delete calls.  
 
Azure Policy expands its at-scale enforcement capabilities to assess requests based on action. Previously, Policy only supported the ‘deny’ effect which blocks requests based on resource configurations or properties. Now a newly added effect, Deny Action, extends that functionality to block based on intended request.  
 
Deny Action effect can be leveraged in the existing policy definitions schema. This allows for the conditional flexibility that comes with the “If” structure of a policy definition. Further, by assigning these definitions at subscription or management group level, deny action can help block these actions at-scale. Applicable resources will show a “Protected” compliance state to signify that the resource is protected from an unwanted action.  
 
 
Get started   
 
Here’s a sample Custom Deny Action Definition:

We want to deploy Azure Policies with our Managed application to ensure the solution stays compliant and security standards are enforced. Is there a way for us, as a publisher, to get alerted if the policies deployed with the Managed application are violated and then quickly engage with the customers to ensure that their deployment is secure? 
 
The short answer was no, so we built one! 
We are open-sourcing the code for this solution so that other publishers can adopt this approach to ensure customers' Managed applications are secure. For more context on the solution described here please read Microsoft documentation on planning a Managed application and Azure Policy.

Currently ARO doesn't support Managed Identity, hence we are using Azure Active Directory Service Principal approach. Managed Identity support for ARO is coming soon. One of the major drawbacks with Service Principal approach is that the client secret will have an expiry date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suppose you're deploying a web application that relies on a database. Instead of manually configuring the database each time you deploy your application, you can use an Init Container to handle this task. The Init Container can run scripts to create tables, seed initial data, or set up the database schema. Once the database is ready, the main application container can safely start, knowing that the required database structure is in place.
 
The below example defines an init container which runs under the same pod as main app container, seeds data to an existing Azure MySQL Database which will be used by the main web app container to serve contents onto the landing page.
 

 
The init container inserts a record into an existing table named myguests in Azure My SQL DB using a python script. The script contains code for connecting to the Database alongside inserting record into the Database. This data will then be retrieved and used by the main app container which is also running a python Flask based web application and return the value in the landing page.
 
Dockerfile for Init Container
 
 
 
FROM python
COPY . .
RUN pip install mysql && pip install mysql-connector-python
CMD ["python", "test.py"]

 
 
 
 
Python Script for Init Container
 
 
 
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="init-test.mysql.database.azure.com",
  user="*******",
  password="*******",
  database="*****"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

sql = "INSERT INTO myguests (firstname, lastname, email) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'test@outlook.com')"

mycursor.execute(sql)

mydb.commit()

print(mycursor.rowcount, "record(s) affected")

 
 
 
 
Output from Init Container

The last thing you want is for a code change or new feature to negatively impact your app's performance. That's where load testing swoops in to save the day. But what if we told you there's an even cooler way to handle load testing? Yep, you guessed it – automating it with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using Azure Pipelines and Azure Load Testing.
 
Why automate load tests with CI/CD?
Before we jump into the nitty-gritty, let's understand why automating load tests with CI/CD is a game-changer:

Detect issues early: By integrating load tests into your CI/CD pipeline, you can detect performance issues early . Address problems before they reach production, reducing the impact on end-users.

When using zip deploy way to deploy to function app from Azure DevOps, the new deployment never complete at DevOps side until manually cancel it.
 
Bad: 

 
Good:

 
Resolution: 
1. Enable debug log at DevOps side and then check if there are many requests to "/api/deployments/latest" with 202, if yes, continue.  
2. Check under "LogFiles/kudu/trace" in kudu portal, find log with name like below at the same time range for current deployment. If many logs show the deployment is pending at same deployment id, then continue. 

3. Go to "site/deployments" in kudu portal to find the folder whose name is same as the deployment id, then check status.xml or status_complete.xml and log.log inside the folder. If status in status.xml or status_complete.xml is not Success or Failed, then we can try to resolve the issue by removing this folder under "site/deployments".
4. Check the log with name like below under "LogFiles/kudu/trace" at the same time for the non-completed deployment task to get more details of the cause why the deployment at that time was not completed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In some scenarios, you might need to preprocess files before they're used by your application. For instance, you're deploying a machine learning model that relies on precomputed data files. An Init Container can download, extract, or preprocess these files, ensuring they are ready for the main application container. This approach simplifies the deployment process and ensures that your application always has access to the required data.
 
The below example defines a simple Pod that has an init container which downloads a file from some resource to a file share which is shared between the init and main app container. The main app container is running a php-apache image and serves the landing page using the index.php file downloaded into the shared file space.
 

 
The init container mounts the shared volume at /mydir , and the main application container mounts the shared volume at /var/www/html. The init container runs the following command to download the file and then terminates: wget -O /mydir/index.php http://info.cern.ch. 
 
Configurations and dockerfile for init container:
 

Mount the storage file share on the environment level
Create init container with mounting file share named init on path /mydir:


 
 

Dockerfile for init which downloads an index.php file under /mydir:

 
FROM busybox:1.28 
WORKDIR / 
ENTRYPOINT ["wget", "-O", "/mydir/index.php", "http://info.cern.ch"]
 
 
 
Configuration for main app container:
 

Create main app container mounting file share named init on path /var/www/html:


 
 

Main app container configuration which uses php-apache image and serves the index.php file from DocumentRoot /var/www/html:

Since its inception nearly two years ago, Azure Container Apps (ACA) has added significant features to make it a relevant container hosting platform. Built atop Kubernetes, Azure Container Apps is a fully managed Platform-as-a-Service that empowers Azure container workloads to focus on the business value they provide, not be mired in infrastructure management. Many of my colleagues and I believe that Azure Container Apps has grown into a viable alternative for hosting many different containers compared to other, more specialized hosting platforms in Azure. No longer must customers learn the ins and outs of Kubernetes, cluster management, Kubernetes versions, etc. The gap to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) has been reduced significantly, and while the two products are not intend…]]></summary>

While if App Service enables Private Endpoint, the webhook from container registry should be blocked with 403 since the public access to the App Service kudu site (advanced tool site) is blocked by default. And when webhook event is trying sent to app service via Private Endpoint, it should fail with IP forbidden.

Query data in Azure Resource Graph
As Azure Resource Graph continues to expose more valuable data, you can now create cross-service queries between Log Analytics workspaces and Azure Resource Graph.
Here are some sample Azure Log Analytics queries that use the new Azure Resource Graph cross-service query capabilities:
 

Filter a Log Analytics query based on the results of an Azure Resource Graph query

- Filter your KQL query to get only virtual machines that are from Standard_D typle that has data:
 
arg("").Resources
| where type == "microsoft.compute/virtualmachines" and properties.hardwareProfile.vmSize startswith "Standard_D"
| join (
    Heartbeat
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
    | distinct Computer
    )
    on $left.name == $right.Computer
 

Create an alert rule that applies only to certain resources taken from an ARG query- Exclude resources based on tags – for example, not to trigger alerts for VMs with a “Test” tag.

arg(״״).Resources| where tags.environment=~'Test'| project name - Retrieve performance data related to CPU utilization and filter to resources with the “prod” tag:

        <updated>2023-09-01T01:34:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Java dependency version conflict occurs when two or more dependencies in your project have incompatible versions of the same class or resource. This can cause runtime errors, unexpected behavior, or compilation failures in your Java application. Sometimes it is hard to detect them, while with the help of IDEA Maven Helper, it has never been so simple.
 
1. Install the plugin
In IntelliJ IDEA, choose File -> Settings -> Plugins. Within the Marketplace tab, search for Maven Helper and click Install.

 
2. Leverage the plugin
Open the pom.xml file of your project and switch to the Dependency Analyzer tab at the bottom.

You will see three options: Conflicts, All Dependencies as List, and All Dependencies as Tree. Choose Conflicts to see if there are any dependency conflicts in your project.

 
3. Resolve conflict
To resolve a conflict, you can right-click on a dependency on the left panel and choose Exclude. This will add an exclusion tag to your pom.xml file and remove the dependency from your project. Alternatively, you can also choose a compatible version of the dependency that works with all other dependencies and declare it explicitly in your pom.xml file using the dependencyManagement section.
After resolving a conflict, you can refresh the Dependency Analyzer tab to see if there are any remaining conflicts. You can also use the All Dependencies as List or All Dependencies as Tree options to see all the dependencies in your project in different formats.

 
4. Conclusion
Dependency conflicts can be difficult to detect, but they can cause a lot of problems in the project. By using the above-mentioned technique and following best practices to prevent dependency conflicts, you can ensure your application runs smoothly without any issues.

APIs often return a large amount of data. Pagination allows you to retrieve a manageable subset of this data at a time, preventing unnecessary strain on resources and reducing the likelihood of timeouts or errors.
In this example, the client starts by requesting the first page of data from the server. The server responds with both the data and metadata indicating the current page, the total number of records. The client then proceeds to request subsequent pages of data until it reaches the last page. This approach allows for efficient data retrieval and processing without overwhelming the client or the server.

It is quite a common requirement when working with API gateways (such as Azure API Management) to understand how many users are actively accessing your applications in the backend. However, the solution for that is not the same for everyone. For instance, a metric exposed out-of-the-box is the total number of HTTP requests... but that doesn't tell us how many unique users we have. Normally, an application running in the client devices generates multiple HTTP requests towards the backend.
So... How can we get the number of active and unique users from Azure API Management data?

        <updated>2023-08-22T09:37:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We can follow the below steps to remove the PHP X-Powered-By header from HTTP response for PHP 8.x apps on Linux App Service –
By default, PHP version is getting displayed as in the below screenshot-

 
 Updating PHP Settings-

Go to your KUDU site https://<sitename>.scm.azurewebsites.net.
Select Bash or SSH from the top menu.
In Bash/SSH, go to your "/home/site" directory.
Create a directory called "ini" (i.e. mkdir ini)
Change directories to "ini".
We'll need to create an "ini" file to add our settings to.  In this example, I'm using "settings.ini".  There are no file editors such as Vi, Vim, or Nano so we'll simply use echo to add the settings to the file.  I'm changing the expose_php setting to Off.  Below is the command that I used to add the setting and create an "settings.ini" file if one doesn't already exist.

 NOTE:  If you already have an extensions.ini file, you can use the same command which will add the new setting to the file. 
/home/site/ini>echo " expose_php = Off " >> settings.ini
If using SSH, you can use vi to create/edit the settings file using the following commands.

 vi settings.ini
 Press "i" on your keyboard to start editing and add the following.

 expose_php = Off  
3. Press "Esc", then ":wq!" and enter to save.
Add an Application Setting-
We'll now need to go to the Azure Portal and add an Application Setting to scan the "ini" directory
              1) Go to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com) and select your App Service Linux PHP application.
              2) Select Application Settings for the app.
              3) Under the Application settings section, press the "+ Add new setting".
              4) For the App Setting Name, enter "PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR". For the value, enter "/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d:/home/site/ini"
 
Testing – 
Go to kudu site and run the command below and you can verify that PHP header is removed.
CURL -I <site url pointing to a PHP script>]]></summary>

Recently, I have touched on a case when the customer would like to interact with Azure PowerShell Function to work with Storage Account and SFTP server. There are some advantages why customers would like to apply for this solution:

PowerShell allows IT admins to apply system-level integration with other components more easily.
Azure Functions provide the convenience of URI/timer-triggered maintenance tasks.

Demand Analysis
We will first start with the demand analysis. The task will be divided into the following sections:

Pull the required file contents from Azure Storage Account, and store them inside Azure Function App.
Upload files to another VM via SFTP.
To work with Azure resources, we also need to apply proper authentication to enhance security.

This year at Microsoft Build we demonstrated Visual Studio pre-caching for Microsoft Dev Box, one of the many integrations that make using Visual Studio on Microsoft Dev Box a great experience. Now with Visual Studio 17.7, you can try out pre-caching for yourself on Microsoft Dev Box.
 
Visual Studio utilizes many caches to increase the performance of key features like Find in Files and IntelliSense. When opening a solution for the first time these caches must be generated by indexing and processing the codebase. Working with large solutions can add a significant amount of time to startup while these caches are created. Once the caches are created Visual Studio can quickly use these features.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) supports integration of KEDA with your AKS cluster to scale your workloads based on Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus metrics from your Azure Monitor workspace.
 
Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus (also known as Managed Prometheus in Azure) is a fully managed Prometheus service in Azure (it includes a fully managed data store, query service, ruler service, Prometheus compatible query APIs, and managed add-on for data collection from, ARC-connected on-prem or other cloud Kubernetes offerings). As a first step, this service is fully integrated with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as an add-on which scrapes Prometheus metrics.
 
To integrate KEDA into your Azure Kubernetes Service, you will need to deploy and configure a workload identity or pod identity on your cluster. This identity allows KEDA to authenticate with Azure and retrieve metrics for scaling from your Monitor workspace.
 
We recommend using Azure Active Directory workload identity. This authentication method replaces pod-managed identity (pod-managed identity in AKS has been deprecated as of 10/24/2022), which integrates with the Kubernetes native capabilities to federate with any external identity providers on behalf of the application.
 
Azure Managed Prometheus support starts from KEDA v2.10. If you have an older version of KEDA installed, you must upgrade in order to work with Azure Managed Prometheus.
 
To integrate KEDA into your AKS, please start with our documentation, and reach out to us should you have any feedback or questions!]]></summary>

As business grows, one common challenge is ensuring your legacy web applications cater to a growing user base without overstretching resources and costs. Such companies don’t want to expand the team size or drastically re-factor the existing application, they need a solution that aligns with their growth goals while optimizing their resources.

I. What is Epoch?
Epoch is a unique identifier (epoch value) that the service uses, to enforce partition/lease ownership. Thus, epoch features allow one consumer to have exclusive access to a partition despite the competition from other consumers from the same consumer group to use that same partition. This protocol is used from the Event Processor Host (EPH) SDK by using CreateEpochReceiver method. For more information, please visit the following link.

While the our work environments became more and more complex, the need of automation is a fact. Therefore ,I made a demo on how you can automate various administrative tasks performed on a Service Fabric Cluster using the sfctl module and trigger them via Azure Function. On Function, we deploy a Docker Container that has all the necessary tools and permissions to access SF Cluster. The Azure Service Fabric command-line interface (CLI) is a command-line utility for interacting with and managing Service Fabric entities, like cluster, applications and services. Basically, we can automate any kind of operation that is supported via the sfctl package.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Q1: What are cipher suites and how do they work on App Service?

A cipher suite is a set of instructions that contains algorithms and protocols to help secure network connections between clients and servers. By default, the front-end’s OS would pick the most secure cipher suite that is supported by both the front-end and the client. However, if the client only supports weak cipher suites, then the front-end’s OS would pick a weak cipher suite that they both support.
App Service does SSL termination on the Frontend layer, which happens before the frontend instances forward requests to workers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are multiple ways to increase the concurrency of python function app. I drew an architecture diagram, which can give us an overall understanding of the function app.
 

Based on the diagram, we can see we could increase function app concurrency by increasing instance count, python worker count and thread count. To better understand this, I build several labs to validate this. I will not demonstrate instance count as it is easy to understand. All these labs are having 4 concurrent incoming requests and each request takes 10 seconds to complete.
 
Lab1:
code:
sync

Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=1
Result:
It took 40 seconds to complete the 4 executions. We can see these 4 executions were triggered at the same time, this is because the function host level is using async. But actually these executions are executed one by one.

Lab2:
code: The same as Lab1.
Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=2
Result:
It took 20 seconds to complete the 4 executions.

 
Lab3:
code: The same as Lab1.
Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=2PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=2
Result:
It took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.

Lab4:
code:
async

Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=1
Result:
It took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.

 
Conclusion:
1.We can increase the concurrency by increasing FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT and PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT. Just note that we can configure the concurrent setting in host.json file. This is the bottleneck of the concurrency. 
2.It is more recommended to use async method instead of sync method as async has better performance than sync with the same configuration.

Ensuring critical resources have the proper guard rails in place also adds to the complexity of resource management.

Cleanup: resources with the same lifecycle are often created across multiple scopes, adding the complexity of many 1-to-1 operations for updating/deleting (e.g. deleting test Storage accounts or VMs across many RGs).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a PHP developer, sometimes you might want to set the custom configuration file (.ini) to read when PHP starts up. For this article, I would like demonstrate how to load custom configuration file (.ini) in the Azure App Service.
 
By default, we set the PHP_INI_DIR = /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d, so when using SSH on Kudu, you could see there are lots of .ini files:

 
Based on this, you might think we could just manually add our custom .ini files in /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d, but it will not work after restart. Since only "/home" data will be persistent after restarting App Service. So what we need to do is to add our .ini in "/home", E.g. "/home/site/ini"
 
For example, if I would like to modify "upload_max_filesize to 64M (defualt is 2M) and post_max_size to 64M (default is 8M)" for the PHP website, I could follow the below steps to achieve it:
 
Step 1:
Use like vi/vim command to add setting.ini file in the "/home/site/ini" folder

 
Step 2:
PHP supports scanning multiple directories for .ini files. For this we need to set PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR with ":" to separate values on the Application Setting for the target App Service.
E.g. PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR = :/home/site/ini
This ensures that we load *.ini files from  /usr/local/etc/php and then load from /home/site/ini

 
 
After, we check the value by simple php page and it will show upload_max_size and post_max_size are set as 64M now.

  The SSV2 feature starts or stops Azure Virtual Machines instances across multiple subscriptions. It starts or stops virtual machines on user-defined   schedules, provides insights through Azure Application Insights, and sends optional notifications by using action groups.
  Azure offers an ARM template for deployment. So, you can easily deploy SSV2 using GitHub.
  For more detail, please see the SSV2 docs.
 
Purpose of SSV2
 The main purpose of using SSV2 is to save costs. By using Scheduled SSV2, we can turn on the VM only during business hours (ex. 9AM-6PM) and shut it down the rest of the time. Also, we can set the VM to automatically shut down when not in use by the Auto Stop function.In this post, I focus on how much we can save VM resource costs using SSV2.

Each pillar brings unique capabilities to the table and enhances the functionality, usability, and productivity of applications and users. In this post you'll learn more about these three pillars and how they can be integrated into apps using Microsoft Cloud services such as Azure OpenAI, Azure Communication Services (ACS), and Microsoft Graph. After you learn about the pillars, you can get hands-on experience provisioning cloud services and working with code in a hands-on tutorial available at https://aka.ms/openai-acs-msgraph. To get started, let's look at a high-level overview of the application.

TypeScript continues to grow in popularity and for good reason. It adds “guard rails” to your code to help you spot issues early on, easily locate problem code, enhance productivity, provide consistency across code, and much more. While there are a lot of TypeScript resources out there to get started learning the language, where can you go to get started quickly without wasting a lot of time?I recently published a series of short videos on TypeScript core concepts that can provide a great starting point. The videos are short, super focused, and many of them use the online TypeScript Playground to demonstrate different concepts. There are a few videos on getting started working with TypeScript locally on your machine as well. You can use TypeScript to build many different typ…]]></summary>

To limit the traffic within the container app environment, an Nginx container was utilized as a reverse proxy server and public endpoint to direct all inbound traffics to the appropriate container app based on the URL. The traffic flow for this architecture is as follows:

To demonstrate how to achieve this, I created a simple proof-of-concept (POC) and would like to share the configuration details in case anyone is interested in creating a similar system.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Static Web App offers two types of preview environments: branch environment and named environment. Both of these methods offer isolated environments for testing and deploying changes to your Azure Static Web App, allowing you to test and validate changes without affecting the main production environment.
 
Here are the steps to create a preview environment:
 
1. After deploying the production branch to the main site, create a new branch based on the main branch and name it "dev".


 
2. Modify your YAML file in the dev branch to include "dev" in the trigger to track any changes in the dev branch.

 
3. Set "production_branch" to the name of your production branch. This action will ensure the deploy task in the dev branch creates a new preview environment.

 
4. Save the changes and after deployment, you can see a new environment named 'dev' for the dev branch.

 
5. If you want to name a preview environment separately (instead of using the branch name), set the "deployment_environment" to the desired name, and it will create a named environment.

 

 
The main difference between branch and named environments is that branch environments are created automatically based on the branch name, whereas named environments are custom-named. 
 
Overall, both branch and named environments provide isolated environments for testing and deploying changes to your Azure Static Web App, allowing you to test and validate changes without affecting the main production environment. The choice of environment type typically depends on the specific needs and development process of your project.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Encrypting data at rest is a primary step in securing a Kubernetes cluster. KMS provides an interface for a provider to utilize a key stored in an external key service to perform this encryption. While KMS v1 on AKS enabled the encryption of Kubernetes secrets using a key in Azure Key Vault, it was limited to only supporting encryption of 2000 secrets. To address this limitation, the Azure Container Upstream team, in collaboration with the Kubernetes community, spearheaded the enhancement project. After being part of two Kubernetes releases, this feature has graduated to beta in Kubernetes v1.27. As soon as KMS v2 became beta in v1.27, Microsoft promptly made it available on AKS as one of many security enhancement features available to its users. For a full list of KMSv2 enhancements, check out this Kubernetes blog post.
For clusters at version v1.27+ with KMS newly enabled, KMS v2 is configured by default. However, for clusters with KMS enabled at versions below v1.27, upgrading to v1.27 will be blocked . To upgrade, follow the steps outlined in this documentation for migrating from KMS v1 to v2, and then proceed with upgrading the cluster to version v1.27. Running your v1.27 AKS cluster with KMS v2 feature enabled, you can now encrypt more than 2000 secrets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overview:
We can secure a custom DNS name with the help of TLS/SSL binding in Azure App Service.
 
When hosting a website on Azure App Service, it is important to ensure that the site is secure and can be accessed via a custom domain name. This can be achieved by using TLS/SSL binding, which encrypts data transmitted to and from the website, thereby ensuring that sensitive information is protected. With this setup, users can access the website via a custom domain name, which adds an extra layer of professionalism and branding to the site.
 
Issue:
The users are not able to purchase and bind the app service certificate for their app service having a custom domain with a special character from Azure Portal.
 
Solution and recommendations:

Azure by default does not provide the facility to purchase the custom domain with the special character except periods and dashes.

 


The user can purchase the custom domain outside Azure with special characters apart from periods and dashes.
In this case, the user will not be able to purchase the App Service Certificate from Azure with the custom domain consists a special character.
To purchase and bind the Certificate with such domain from Azure Portal, the custom domain first needs to be converted to its Punny code using the below converter:

 
Punycode converter (IDN converter), Punycode to Unicode :wrench:(punycoder.com)

 

Purchase the certificate with the Punny code custom domain and bind the certificate with the app service custom domain.

Add and manage TLS/SSL certificates - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn
 

Browse the app service to verify the SSL Certificate.


 
If this helps you, do let me know via like and comments section, cheers!
Happy Learning!

Azure Event Hubs is a big data streaming platform that collects events from multiple sources to be ingested by Azure and external services.  
The new ability to ingest data can be powerful for customers who already use message queueing mechanisms and are interested in ingesting data into a Log Analytics or Sentinel workspace, or ingesting into multiple destinations.
Customers who use Kafka can connect their applications to a Kafka endpoint on an event hub without any code changes.
 
The main benefits of this feature are:

Highly scalable and reliable ingestion - start ingest megabytes of data and grow to gigabytes or terabytes.
Fully managed service that doesn’t require use and maintenance of other components like functions, Logic Apps, and plugins to ingest data from Event Hubs into a Log Analytics workspace.
Requires minimum configuration with flexibility to add more advanced configurations using transformations.

The new ability to ingest data can be powerful for customers who already use message queueing mechanisms and are interested in ingesting data into a Log Analytics or Sentinel workspace, or ingesting into multiple destinations.
Customers who use Kafka can connect their applications to a Kafka endpoint on an event hub without any code changes.
 
The main benefits of this feature are:

Highly scalable and reliable ingestion - start ingest megabytes of data and grow to gigabytes or terabytes.
Fully managed service that doesn’t require use and maintenance of other components like functions, Logic Apps, and plugins to ingest data from Event Hubs into a Log Analytics workspace.
Requires minimum configuration with flexibility to add more advanced configurations using transformations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a web technology designed to enable servers to transmit data to clients without the need for client-initiated requests. SSE proves to be highly advantageous for applications requiring real-time updates, such as chat platforms, news feeds, or stock price trackers. Traditionally, these applications would involve clients repeatedly requesting data from servers at predefined intervals.
 
This blog post delves into the configuration process of setting up a server-sent events (SSE) API within Azure API Management (APIM). APIM is a comprehensive service offering the creation, publication, management, and security of APIs. APIM facilitates SSE APIs by applying a specialized policy that enables the seamless transmission of streaming responses.

Have you ever walked into a store, did some shopping, and headed back home only to find that you forgot to buy 60% of the items you needed to get?
I struggle with this very same issue and so I decided to create the ‘Smart Shopping Planner’, an application that will help me keep track of the items I need to buy and that I can easily update before and after shopping.
 
Smart Shopping Planner is a React application built using JavaScript, that stores data in an Azure SQL database. In this blog, I want to show you how incredibly easy it was to provide REST endpoints (you can work with GraphQL too) to connect the app to the database.

Federated credentials / workload identity federation allows your CI/CD pipelines in GitHub and GitLab to access your Azure subscription without any secrets stored in the pipeline config.
GitHub's azure/login@1 task handles this transparently, but I also explain how it works under the hood. GitLab supplies the necessary token directly to your pipeline run.
Both GitHub and GitLab are easy to setup and federate securely with your Azure subscription.
BitBucket can't be setup that way, because tokens issued by BitBucket don't have a predicable subject identifier.

In this blog, I explain how such a framework could be implemented through the use of prompt engineering for GPT to create a reflective, deeper format for learning. We are exploring some of these ideas in our AI courses at the University of Oxford, however all views expressed here are solely my own.

Why would you go through the hassle of a complete migration project if you end up with something just as inflexible, as monolithic, and as intrinsically inconvenient as the platform you’re moving away from?

Introduction 
 
Recently I am having an increasing number of conversations with customers on how best to manage container images in disconnected or highly restricted environments. Cluster security is becoming increasingly more important, a 2023 report by Red Hat showed that 90% of enterprises surveyed had experienced a security incident in their Kubernetes environments in the last 12 months.
 
There is certainly a trend from customers recently to harden environments making the most of Azure Services such as Azure Firewall to manage egress traffic or Network security groups to restrict traffic within an Azure Subscription. When doing this a problem arises regarding how to manage public container images that may b…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Grounding?
Grounding is the process of using large language models (LLMs) with information that is use-case specific, relevant, and not available as part of the LLM's trained knowledge. It is crucial for ensuring the quality, accuracy, and relevance of the generated output. While LLMs come with a vast amount of knowledge already, this knowledge is limited and not tailored to specific use-cases. To obtain accurate and relevant output, we must provide LLMs with the necessary information. In other words, we need to "ground" the models in the context of our specific use-case.
 
Motivation for Grounding
The primary motivation for grounding is that LLMs are not databases, even if they possess a wealth of knowledge. They are designed to be used as general reasoning and text engines. LLMs …]]></summary>

A common problem encountered when having Azure App Service behind Azure Application Gateway is
whether we can use the cookie-based affinity feature on Azure Application Gateway end instead to maintain session stickiness.
 

 
Answer is NO. Because as explained at Azure - Inside the Azure App Service Architecture | Microsoft Learn Azure App Service is distributed system 
and has its own frontend workers and backend workers, 
enabling cookie-based affinity on Application Gateway side only allows requests from the same end user to 
get routed to the same App Service frontend workers within a session

When a Function App is added as an API in APIM, there are some authorization details we need to consider while communicating from APIM to the backend function app.
It does not matter what Authorization level (function or anonymous) the function app has configured, APIM will always attach a function host key to the request. The host key is attached to the request as a header. However, we may experiment unauthorized errors even though the function host key is present in the request header.
So, this article is focused on analyzing one of those scenarios when communication between APIM and backend function app is truncated due to unauthorized errors.

You must be wondering how to find out total number of partition count for any Event Hub namespace??
 
On the Azure portal you can only see partition count per Event Hub Entity level but not Namespace level. It’s tiresome job to manually sum up partition counts of all the entities especially when you have hundreds of event hub entities under the namespace.
 
Here is a simple way to find out total number of Partitions under Event Hub namespace using PowerShell script.
 
Solution:
 
Use below PowerShell script to see the total number of Partitions under your namespace.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction and Purpose: 
 
Existing example reference architectures to implement network connectivity between Azure and Azure VMware Solutions (AVS) recommend the use of ExpressRoute Global Reach where available. However, there are also scenarios where either Global Reach is not available (such as Brazil South), or customers simply might have different requirements and need an alternate solution that substitutes Global Reach entirely.   
 
Generally speaking, one viable solution is to implement a public Site-to-Site VPN with Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) while enabling transit capabilities between an ExpressRoute Gateway and a VPN gateway. The goal here is to advertise AVS or other non-overlapping IP address spaces dynamically via BGP. This is commonly referred to as Overlay. For a Hub a…]]></summary>

Humility is an important ingredient and certainly collaboration across different groups is too, but especially in the architecture discipline. Because in the architecture discipline, there's no other discipline that he can think of in which you go from thinking that you know a lot, and you do know a lot, to the next day being “I've never heard of that and now let me learn about it.” If …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce Code-to-Cloud (preview), one of the fastest and easiest way to deploy and manage your web apps on Azure. Code-to-Cloud is a portal-based experience that takes an app-first approach to building, deploying, and running your apps. Code-to-Cloud makes it easier for developers to get started using Azure, without needing to be an expert on the hundreds of different cloud services. 
 
Detect the right Azure services from your repository
 

 
Code-to-Cloud lets you connect your GitHub repositories to Azure, and through analysis of the code inside your GitHub repository, suggests the correct Azure services you should use. Once you deploy, GitHub Actions is used to create a continuous deployment pipeline between your repositories and your newly provisioned cloud services. Once you've deployed your app via Code-to-Cloud, changes to your code will immediately be pushed to your connected Azure services. 
 
Bring your own repository or start from a template
 

 
Code-to-Cloud also provides sample templates, powered by Azure Developer CLI, that provide a helpful blueprint for getting started with Azure. You can use these templates to immediately create a GitHub repository, connect it to Azure, and provision a distinct set of services for the template scenario. Our templates include sample static websites, web apps, and APIs, in a variety of different languages.
 
Manage your app in a consolidated view
 

 
 
In addition to making it easier and faster to get started developing, Code-to-Cloud also provides a simplified, app-centric management experience. A "Space" is a loose collection of cloud services that, collectively, comprise the app you are building. You can manage your compute, database, caching, and other key services all within the same, easy-to-use management experience.
 
To get started immediately, you can check out Code-to-Cloud here. You can also read our documentation to get a better look at what Code-to-Cloud can do for you.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using Event Hubs capture feature, you can load real-time streaming data to data lakes, warehouses, and other storage services, so that they can be processed or analyzed by analytics services.
We're thrilled to announce the General Availability of Managed Identity support for capturing event streams in Azure Event Hubs.
 
Managed Identities when capturing event streams.
With managed identity, users can seamlessly capture data to a preferred destination by using Azure Active Directory based authentication and authorization. You can use system-assigned or user-assigned managed identities with Event Hubs capturing destinations.
Managed identities provide an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure AD authentication. Applications can use managed identities to obtain Azure AD tokens without having to manage any credentials.

 
In the context of Event Hubs capture feature, these manage identities are used to authenticate and authorize the event capturing agent with the capture destinations such as Azure Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen1 or Gen2.
When configuring event capturing for a given event hub/Kafka topic, users can enable capture and select system assigned or user assigned identity as the authentication mode.

 
Event Hubs Capture feature also supports capturing data to a capture destination in a different subscription with the use of managed identity.

        <updated>2023-05-23T15:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dev tunnels are a powerful tool to securely open your localhost to the internet and control who has access, so you can easily test and debug your web apps and webhooks from virtually anywhere. With dev tunnels, you can also share your local work in-progress with colleagues or clients to get feedback asynchronously without the hassle of deploying. Previously, the only way you could use dev tunnels was through Visual Studio 2022.
 
Today, we are thrilled to announce the public preview of the devtunnel CLI! To create, host, and connect to your first dev tunnel in seconds, please follow the documentation on Microsoft Learn.
 

 
Use cases
Here are some of the scenarios that dev tunnels enable with the devtunnel CLI or dev tunnels in Visual Studio 2022.

Test an app with external services. For instance, test and debug Power Platform connectors, Azure Communication Services APIs, or Twilio webhooks.
Test and debug a web app on other devices, like mobile phones and tablets.
Make an app temporarily available to others to review your work in progress on a web app or API.

Benefits

Secure by default – Each dev tunnel you create is only accessible to you using your Microsoft, Microsoft Azure Active Directory or GitHub account.
Persistent URLs - Retain the same tunnel URL for extended periods of time.
Support for multiple simultaneous ports - Host multiple ports on a single tunnel at the same time.
Global service availability - The dev tunnels service is available globally. Tunnels are automatically created in the closest available region to ensure optimal performance.
Tunnel inspection - Inspect tunnel traffic in a familiar interface, browser DevTools, to monitor and manage your web apps or webhooks.

To improve the devtunnel CLI, we encourage you to connect with us through GitHub issues to request a feature or submit a bug. We look forward to hearing your feedback!]]></summary>

In this article you will learn how to perform a manual failover to restore service as part of the task to identify the root cause of the problem even though the server is unresponsive.
 
A working example: One potential cause of an unresponsive Azure SQL database is a query that is fired by an API and consumes 100% of the CPU. In this scenario, it can be difficult to identify the problematic query without connection which allows you to query the data management views (DMVs) and pinpoint the problematic query. Once identified, you can disable the API until a fix is implemented.

This also plays a role in the security aspect of the service, so the service itself can protect customers from malicious behavior attacking their service Additionally, this call rate allows customers to estimate their usage and manage costs effectively by preventing unexpected spikes in traffic that…]]></summary>

Today we will be discussing the term concentration risk, which means concentrating your solution on one technology and how to avoid what one architect terms ‘silly miracles’. Our hosts will be David Blank-Edelman and our armchair architects Uli Homann and Eric Charran.
 
Eric defines concentration risk and gives an example.
 
Eric has friends in the financial services industry and the term concentration risk to them means over indexing or over investment in a specific area to the harm of the larger portfolio. The term concentration risk is gaining traction in the technology space also, specifically the architecture space because the same dangers of safeguarding your investment also exist.

Mais de quoi s'agit-il exactement et comment cette vidéo pourrait-elle vous aider? 
 
Apprenons .NET - Azure ce partage en deux parties. 
 
La première est une introduction au concept de base du cloud. Pour ce faire nous avons utilisé les trois modules du chemin d'apprentissage: Principes de base de Microsoft Azure: description des concepts du cloud.

Décrire le cloud computing
Décrire les avantages de l’utilisation des services cloud
Décrire les types de services cloud

En plus du contentue de ces modules, nous avons aussi partagé notre expérience provenant de cas réels.  Ce parcours d’apprentissage vous aide à vous préparer pour l'Examen AZ-900: Principes de base Microsoft Azure.
 
La deuxième partie est une introduction l'utilisation de .NET avec Azure. Nous avons construit un site web que nous avons déployé sur Azure en suivant les étoupes du module.
