        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When building HTTP APIs, it can be tempting to synchronously run long-running tasks in a request handler. This approach can lead to slow responses, timeouts, and resource exhaustion. If a request times out or a connection is dropped, the client won't know if the operation completed or not. For CPU-bound tasks, this approach can also bog down the server, making it unresponsive to other requests.
 
In this post, we'll look at how to build an asynchronous HTTP API with Azure Container Apps. We'll create a simple API that implements the Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern: with the API hosted in a container app and the asynchronous processing done in a job. This approach provides a much more robust and scalable solution for long-running tasks.

        <updated>2024-08-09T20:39:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The article discusses a problem where numerous messages end up in the dead letter queue (DLQ) when the JMS service bus consumer connects to the Azure Service Bus using Qpid jars. The reason for the messages being dead-lettered is that they have reached the maximum delivery count.
 
The fundamental issue stems from Apache Qpid's message handling. Qpid utilizes a local buffer to prefetch messages from the Azure Service Bus, storing them prior to delivery to the consumer. The complication occurs when Qpid prefetches an excessive number of messages that the consumer is unable to process within the lock duration. Consequently, the consumer is unable to acknowledge or finalize the processing of these messages before the lock expires, leading to an accumulation of messages in the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).
 
To address this problem, it is crucial to either turn off Qpid's local buffer or modify the prefetch count. Disabling prefetching is achievable by setting jms.prefetchPolicy.all=0 in the JMS client. This configuration allows the JMS client to directly consume messages from the Azure Service Bus, circumventing Qpid's local buffer. Consequently, the consumer can process messages at a suitable pace, guaranteeing smooth processing and issue-free completion.
 
Why is Prefetch not the default option in Microsoft .NET/Java/Python libs?]]></summary>

This guide is designed for absolute beginners new to LangGraph.js who want to build applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). I began using LangGraph.js as part of my Microsoft MSc Computer Science IXN Final Project at UCL. During my journey, I noticed a need for more beginner-friendly resources, especially for the TypeScript implementation, and found that the official documentation was still in progress. Through this guide, I aim to bridge that gap and showcase the potential of LangGraph.js and Langchain for creating LLM-powered products.

In our latest video, we explored a real-world application of .NET and AI working together.
 Building a LLM from zero
Bruno and Shaltiel hosted this session where the main focus was to showcase how ASP.NET, ONNX Runtime, and TorchSharp are leveraged to build a robust product that handles over 100,000 requests a day in each server instance.
 
The hosts also talked about the integration of different deep learning architectures like BERT models and RNNs, which are focused to minimize latency and maximize performance.
 
During the session Shaltiel showcased how to train a model from zero using Python libraries and how to later export the model to ONNX format and use it in C#. Bringing the best of both worlds.
 


Make sure to check out the full video for an in-depth look at how you can start leveraging these tools today and propel your projects into the future of AI-driven development.

Well maybe you did, but I certainly didn’t. Whenever someone talks about any type of AI-based application, they're almost always talking about Python. So, it was a welcome surprise for me to discover it since I'm way more familiar with Node than Python.
 
I decided to give the Node SDK a go just to see how well it works and stumbled upon a great cookbook tutorial by OpenAI. I took most of the code from that sample as-is, wrote a static front-end chat client for it, and then wired it up as a sample space called “Activity Planner Agent” that you can easily deploy in App Spaces.  The only prerequisite is that you’ll need an OpenAI API key, which we’ll walk through below.

What is it
Azure Web Apps or Azure Function Apps frequently communicate with Application Insights to log various levels of data, which can later be reviewed and filtered in the Log Analytics Workspace.
 
Taking Python as an example, the official documentation mentions that the OpenCensus package will no longer be supported after 2024-09-30.

 
 
The article suggests OpenTelemetry as the latest alternative. In response to the growing cybersecurity awareness among many companies, many users have disabled the 'Local Authentication' feature in Application Insights to enhance security.

 
 
Therefore, this article will focus on how Web Apps/Function Apps can use Managed Identity to communicate with Application Insights and utilize the latest OpenTelem…]]></summary>

Azure Site Recovery (ASR) is a service that often comes to mind when adopting a business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) approach. In summary, ASR continuously replicates workloads running on physical and virtual machines (VMs) from a primary to a secondary site. If disaster strikes and causes an outage, ASR will fail over workloads to the secondary site and ensure applications remain accessible, and later fail back to the primary site once it becomes available again. A secondary ‘site’ may be another Azure region, or a different availability zone in the same Azure region.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A memory dump is a snapshot of the contents of a computer's volatile memory (RAM) stored for analysis or debugging purposes.  ProcDump is a command-line tool designed to monitor applications for CPU/Memory spikes and generate crash dumps when spikes occur. Administrators or developers can then use these dumps to pinpoint the cause of the spikes. This guide will walk you through collecting a memory dump using Procdump.exe for applications hosted on App Service (Windows).
 

Access the Azure Portal and navigate to the desired App Service.
Click on "Advanced Tools" and then "Go ->" to access the SCM/Kudu site.


 

On the SCM site, go to Process Explorer to find the PID of the w3wp.exe process, which is the application worker process.


 

Use the Debug console to open the CMD option.


 

Navigate to the System Drive and access the sysinternals path:

C:\devtools\sysinternals>
Note: The drive letter may vary (e.g., D:\ or C:)



 

Locate the procdump.exe file in the sysinternals directory, which will be used for running commands.
To collect logs for the application worker process, use the PID obtained earlier.
Use the following command to collect a full memory dump.

Procdump.exe -accepteula -ma [PID] [Path]

Path: Specifies the directory where the collected memory dump file will be stored.


Example: procdump.exe -accepteula -ma 5100 C:\dumps\



 

Initiate the dump collection and reproduce the issue the application is facing.


 

After the memory dump collection is complete, access the specific path on the SCM site to download the collected memory dump.



 
You can consult the following article for further details on Procdump commands and various parameters to utilize depending on your specific needs and troubleshooting scenario.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump
 
It's advisable to gather multiple sets of memory dumps because analyzing several dumps can reveal patterns and facilitate the development of an action plan to resolve issues effectively.]]></summary>

This article describes how to copy all Azure Storage Tables data between two different storage accounts.
 
For this, we will use Azure Storage SDK for Python to copy all tables (and the respective data) from one Azure Storage Table to another Azure Storage Table. This approach will keep the data in the source tables, and will create new tables with the respective data in the destination Azure Storage Table.
 
This script was developed and tested using the following versions but it is expected to work with previous versions:

Python 3.11.7
azure-data-tables (version: 12.5.0)
azure-core (version: 1.30.1)

 
Approach
 
In this section, you can find a sample code to copy all tables data between two Storage Accounts using the Azure Storage SDK for Python.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This blog emphasizes the process of gathering profiler traces for application hosted on App Service that is experiencing slowness. It also provides guidance on how to review these collected traces to pinpoint the root cause and take steps towards resolving it.
 

Access the Azure Portal and navigate to the desired App Service.
Navigate to "Diagnose and Solve Problems" -> "Diagnostic Tools"


 

Choose "Collect .NET Profiler Trace" option.
Configure the trace options to gather data from the specific application instance, including thread details.


 

Reproduce the issue at step 2.


 

Access and examine the generated report.


 

In the demo application, a delay of approximately 20 seconds was observed. Refer to the browser network traces provided below.


 

Analyze the profiler traces to pinpoint the cause of the reported delay.


 

After examining the demo app's code, it was evident that a deliberate 20-second delay was introduced in the Privacy method within the Home Controller.


 

Note: Default profiler log collection time is 60 seconds and it is possible to increase the default profiling duration by setting an application setting IIS_PROFILING_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS with a maximum value of 900 (i.e. 15 minutes).]]></summary>

To ensure that these applications deliver a reliable and consistent user experience, testing becomes a critical part of the development process.
 
However, traditional testing approaches that rely on manual testers or brittle scripts are not scalable or reliable enough to meet the demands of modern web development. We need a better way to automate testing of web applications, one that can handle complex user interactions, cross-browser compatibility, and fast feedback loops.

In this blog post we will learn how to do Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using local resources in .NET! We’ll show you how to combine the Phi-3 language model, Local Embeddings, and Semantic Kernel to create a RAG scenario.
What is RAG?
Before we dive into the demo, let’s quickly recap what RAG is. RAG is a hybrid approach that enhances the capabilities of a language model by incorporating external knowledge. In example: using a RAG approach we can retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base and use them to generate more informed and accurate responses. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a LLM needs up-to-date information or specific domain knowledge that isn't contained within its initial training data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year at BUILD we announced the public preview of the Network Observability add-on. Today we’re excited to share a massive upgrade to the network observability capabilities available to AKS customers. 
 
What’s new?
We are excited to announce Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS), a suite of services built to significantly enhance the operational capabilities of your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. Advanced Network Observability is the inaugural feature of the ACNS suite bringing the power of Hubble’s control plane to both Cilium and Non-Cilium Linux data planes. With Advanced Network Observability, customers can now pinpoint network-related issues with more precision and detect root causes faster.  The offering provides pod level packet statistics, DNS statistics, L4 connections and enhanced debugging capabilities with network flow logs and DNS error tracking.
Data flow for Advanced Network Observability
 
How can Azure customers use the new offering?
ACNS is integrated deeply with existing Azure Monitor capabilities for monitoring AKS clusters. Using the new capabilities requires no extra configuration from customers. Customers can enable advanced network observability with a single command. The metrics are then ingested automatically by Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus. Additionally, customers can visualize the metrics in pre-built dashboards in Azure Managed Grafana. Customers have access to 6 pre-built dashboards in Azure Managed Grafana covering a breadth of signals from cluster traffic to DNS and pod level flows.

Believe it or not, not all data is meant for analytics. Sometimes reporting requirements include flat data that is not inherently dimensional. This often includes querying large tables with low cardinality columns. Think of:

Audit trails – understanding who accessed what at a certain point in time or what events occurred when
Financial transaction data – querying financial transactions by invoice id
Web analytics – identifying which pages were accessed at what date, time and location

This type of data can have millions or billions of rows to sift through.
 
So where does this type of reporting fit into your reporting environment? In Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse and Power BI Report Developer paginated reports!

RAG uses information from additional sources to enhance the output of a large language model (LLM).  If you’ve used LLMs like ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot, you’ve probably gotten your fair share of hallucinations, responses that are wrong, often to the point of silliness. In fact, Microsoft Copilot comes with a warning: “Copilot uses AI. Check for mistakes.” RAG grounds the responses in authoritative external knowledge making them more accurate and useful.

As a SaaS service, Fabric offers a complete security package for the entire platform. The Fabric platform comprises of experiences like include Lakehouse, Data Factory, Synapse Data Engineering, Synapse Data Warehouse, Power BI, and others. To understand the security in Fabric we have broken down Fabric components into the following layers:

Fabric Components


Data - Where the data actually resides inside Fabric (Warehouse/Lakehouse/Eventhouse/OneLake/Fabric clusters)
Items - These are the building blocks of the Fabric platform. They're the objects that you create and manage in Fabric. There are different types of items, such as data warehouses, data pipelines, semantic models, reports, and dashboards.

There are many reasons for this symptom, such as connection errors with the storage account, runtime being down, indexing failure, and the synctriggers failure that we'll discuss.
 
To confirm whether your issue is indeed due to synctriggers, you could press F12 in your browser to activate developer mode and search for the keyword "batch" under the "Network" tab. This endpoint is used by the Azure portal to call various internal services of the Function App (e.g., retrieving app settings, site information, getting host status, etc.), including synctriggers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, and welcome to the recap of our latest video on AI and .NET.
 

In our latest video, we went into the fascinating world of Redis and its integration with AI, specifically focusing on how it can enhance .NET applications.
 
Redis and .NET
 
Bruno, Katherine, and Stanley shared their insights on leveraging Redis for building intelligent, high-performance applications. They showcased two compelling demo applications:
 

A .NET Contoso HR web application augmented with AI and Redis for chatbot-style capabilities.
An eShop web application enhanced with AI for intelligent recommendations and improved performance.

The discussion also touched upon key concepts such as large language models, vector similarity search, and retrieval augmented generative AI, providing a comprehensive overview of the technical landscape. The integration of Redis with Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise was particularly emphasized, showcasing its ability to support vector similarity search and offer low latency, which is crucial for real-time applications.
 
This session was a testament to the power of combining Redis with AI to create more dynamic, responsive, and intelligent applications.
 
Resources
For those eager to dive deeper, several resources were shared.
 

Blog: https://aka.ms/redis-ai/04-2024
Documentation:https://aka.ms/redis-ai/vss
Redis branch at https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo-csharp/tree/redis
Vss branch at https://github.com/CawaMS/eShop/tree/vss

These resources provide a great starting point for developers looking to integrate Redis and AI into their own projects.

Large Language Models were trained by data from all over the internet with billions of parameters. To generate an output from LLMs, you need a prompt. For day-to-day questions for example generating a LinkedIn Post from a blog post, you may need additional instructions for your LLM, for example: the word count, tone of the message, the format and the call to action at the end. Using prompty, you can easily standardize your prompt and execute it into a single asset.

Or have you already built a web app with Python, but wondered how you can deploy it online? If so, you might be interested in watching this video by and Pamela Fox and Renee Noble, two Python Cloud Advocates at Microsoft with a passion for web development and education!
 
They’ll show you how to create a web app with Python Flask (or it’s async-sibling Quart) and show you how you can deploy you can take your web app live by deploying it on Azure. This is the first episode in this live stream series (which you can also catch on demand!) by Pamela and friends covering different web dev frameworks and practices! (And you can catch it in Spanish too!)



 
In this video, you will learn how the web works and why you (likely) need a web server to serve up your web app. You will also discover how a backend web framework, like Flask, helps you develop your web server quickly and easily and how it lets you use templates to build dynamic sites - whether it’s your first site or a complex full-scale service.
 
Want to improve your web server throughput? Find out how you can port your app to Quart, the asynchronous version of Flask. And of course, you’ll see how you can deploy your web apps to Azure App Service in minutes and learn what other deployment options you might be interested in seeking out depending on your project.
 
The video is perfect for beginners who have some familiarity with Python, but no prior experience with web development or deployment. It is also suitable for intermediate or advanced developers who want to refresh their skills or learn new tricks. Take a look at the video to learn some concepts and follow along with our coding and deployment demos! You can grab the demo repo here and check out the slides too.]]></summary>

Why we use it
An increasing number of security vulnerabilities are caused by sensitive information in the source code being leaked or accidentally uploaded to open repositories GitHub, leading to the exposure of a large amount of user privacy. This information includes, but is not limited to, database credentials, app keys, etc. Traditional MySQL databases use usernames and passwords for login operations, naturally leading to the inclusion of these credentials in project configuration files. Even with proper safeguards, there remain unpredictable risks, such as hacking.
 
This tutorial will introduce how to integrate Microsoft Entra with Azure Database for MySQL to avoid using fixed usernames and passwords. By utilizing system-ass…]]></summary>

The above linked documentation covers how you would setup the Azure resource with Entra ID as the authentication mode, so I won't go over that here (also, you can configure that when you initial create the database, or using a Bicep script), instead I want to look at how we use that in a .NET application, because when you're connecting using Entra ID you don't have a pas…]]></summary>

We have seen that before load testing these endpoints, most users generate an access token and store it in the Azure Key Vault.

Sometime has elapsed between the act of storing the token in the key vault and the start of execution of the test. There can be a case where the token might expire during the test run and the request at the endpoints start throwing errors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
 
Last week at Build, we've introduced a new feature in Public Preview for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) called Deployment Safeguards.
Deployment Safeguards, as a part of Azure Policy for AKS, provides a configurable and fast way to make sure your Kubernetes deployment follow through best practices and limits that are set beforehand. In this article, we will explore how it works in real time and how can we use it to tailor AKS to your needs.
 
Playground Setup

First, let’s provide an overview of how Cosmos DB is being used in this scenario. As per the architectural overview shown below, there are an ecosystem of Customer systems that emit data, these hit a pipeline and are then inserted into Cosmos DB via a Batch process.

 
The original design from 2019 had only a single container, Data, which contained all of the documents that were ingested into Cosmos DB. As the Data Container grew and reached a point where Query performance and RU/s became prohibitive. An Index Container was introduced to function as an 'Index' for the Data Container. This design change mandated the following data access pattern:

Query the Index container for the Document ID

Azure Load Testing is a cloud-based service that lets you test the performance and scalability of your web applications and APIs. You can create and run load tests, analyze and compare the results, and define test fail criteria based on metrics like response time, error percentage, and throughput.
Response time is the time your application takes to respond to a user request. It depends on factors like network latency, server load, and application logic. To measure the performance of your application, you need to look at the response time distribution across different percentiles, which show how many requests are completed within a certain time limit. For example, the 90th percentile response time means that 90% of the requests are completed within that time, and the remaining …]]></summary>

Users are required to manually configure Microsoft Entra Workload ID or Managed Identities so their AKS workloads can securely access these protected resources.
The Service Connector integration greatly simplifies the connection configuration experience for AKS workloads and Azure backing services. Service Connector takes care of authentication and network configurations securely and follows Azure best practices, so you can focus on your application code without worrying about your infrastructure connectivity.

Service Connector Action Breakdown
 
Before, in order to connect from AKS pods to a private Azure backing services using workload identity, users needed to perform the following actions manually:

Create a managed identity
Retrieve the OIDC issuer URL
Create Kubernetes service account
Establish federated identity credential trust
Grant permissions to access Azure Services
Deploy the application

Now, Service Connector performs steps 2 to 5 automatically. Additionally, for Azure services without public access, Service Connector creates private connection components such as private link, private endpoint, DNS record,
You can create a connection in the Service Connection blade within AKS.

 
Click create and select the target service, authentication method, and networking rule. The connection will then be automatically set up. Here are a few helpful links to for you to learn more about Service Connector.

For example, its AI infrastructure is capable of training and inferencing the most sophisticated large language models at massive scale on Azure. In parallel, Microsoft is also developing some of the most compact small language models with Phi-3, capable of running offline on your mobile phone.
 
Watch Azure CTO and Microsoft Technical Fellow Mark Russinovich demonstrate this hands-on and go into the mechanics of how Microsoft is able to squeeze as much performance from its AI infrastructure as possible to run AI workloads of any size efficiently on a global scale.

At last year's KubeCon North America, Microsoft announced the adoption of Karpenter in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as an alternative to the Cluster Autoscaler (CA), referred to as Node Autoprovisioning (NAP). While Cluster Autoscaler has been the default node scaler in AKS/Kubernetes, there have been significant challenges that led to the adoption of Karpenter. This post delves into these challenges and explores how Karpenter addresses them.
Challenges with Cluster Autoscaler
Here is Node Autosclaing flow chart for Cluster-Autoscaler

Bienvenidos a este nuevo post en el que te vamos a contar lo que vimos en el tercer episodio de "Inteligencia Artificial y .NET", una serie de charlas en vivo que hacemos cada mes con el equipo de Reactor. 
 
En esta ocasión, tuvimos el placer de contar con cuatro ponentes de lujo que nos enseñaron cómo usar diferentes servicios de Azure para crear aplicaciones de IA con .NET, desde modelos generativos de lenguaje hasta chatbots y análisis de texto. 
 
¿Te lo perdiste? No te preocupes, aquí te hacemos un resumen y te compartimos el video y algunos recursos para que puedas seguir aprendiendo.
 
Contenido


Bruno Capuano mostró cómo cambiar entre modelos locales y en la nube con semantic kernel. 3:40


Francis Nicole mostró cómo usar Custom Vision para entrenar un modelo de detección de imágenes con un personaje de dibujos animados, usando Language Studio y Azure portal. También explicó las métricas de rendimiento y los resultados del modelo. 10:47


Pablo Di Loreto presentó algunos servicios de Azure AI que no son generativos, pero útiles para el procesamiento de lenguaje natural y la IA conversacional, como análisis de texto, extracción de frases clave y respuesta a preguntas personalizadas. También demostró cómo usar Language Studio y Azure Bot Service para crear un chatbot con preguntas frecuentes. 21:21


Luis Beltrán explicó cómo usar Azure Functions y SQL para crear un motor de búsqueda de productos basado en embeddings. También mostró cómo usar Azure OpenAI para generar embeddings y Azure Communication Services para conectar con WhatsApp. 33:17

You can now use Azure Spring Apps to effectively run Spring Batch applications with adaptive cost control. You only pay when batch jobs are running, and you can simply lift and shift your Spring Batch jobs with no code change.
 
Spring Batch is a framework for processing large amounts of data in Java applications. It provides reusable functions for logging, transaction management, job statistics, job restart, skipping errors, and resource management. It also supports high-performance tasks through optimization and partitioning. Introduced in March 2008, Spring Batch is popular among Java developers and is part of the Spring portfolio. It is widely used in modern enterprise systems to handle complex batch processing t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are pleased to announce the public preview of large message support (up to 20 MB) in Azure Event Hubs. Azure Event Hubs is a cloud native data streaming service that can stream millions of events per second, with low latency, from any source to any destination. Event Hubs is compatible with Apache Kafka, and it enables you to run existing Kafka workloads without any code changes.
 
The introduction of large message support is a significant enhancement to our service. Typically, data in streaming scenarios is lightweight, often less than 1 MB, and characterized by high throughput. However, there are instances when messages cannot be divided into smaller segments or chunks.
 
With the new support for large messages, Event Hubs self-serve scalable Dedicated clusters can now accommodate events up to 20 MB in size at no additional cost. This capability allows Azure Event Hubs to handle a wide range of message sizes, ensuring uninterrupted business operations.
 
How to enable large message support for Event Hubs
 
Large message streaming is only supported in Event Hubs self-serve scalable dedicated clusters built out of latest infrastructure. For more details, visit aka.ms/largemessagesupportforeh
 
Being able to stream large messages or events requires no client code changes apart from the change in message or event itself. You could continue sending/receiving messages using any existing event hubs SDK / Kafka API to stream large messages to event hub.
 
We’re all ears for your feedback. To Know more, visit:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker with message queues and publish-subscribe topics. Sometimes, you may want to delete messages from your queues and subscriptions in a more programmatic manner, for example, to clear out old or unwanted messages from your entities.  
 
We are excited to announce the public preview of Batch Delete, a new feature that lets you delete messages in bulk from your Service Bus entities. Batch delete helps you to delete multiple messages from a messaging entity in one operation, instead of deleting them one by one. Since deletion is done at service side, you don't need to receive the messages before deleting them.

We are sure you will find the Batch Delete feature a significant improvement in Azure Service Bus and encourage you to explore this new addition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, we're excited to announce that compression for Kafka clients is generally available in Azure Event Hubs.
 
Azure Event Hubs is a cloud native streaming service enabling you to build scalable, durable and low-latency workflows with massive volumes of event data with ease. As you onboard more workloads to Azure and build them around Azure Event Hubs, your bandwidth and storage requirements may scale exponentially.
 
Kafka compression can help with this by reducing the data payloads that are stored and transmitted across your architecture, thus reducing network bandwidth and storage requirements and costs, while still keeping the programming model simple.
 
To utilize Kafka compression, you must set the below setting in the Kafka producer configuration properties -
 
 
compression.type = gzip
 
 
 
No changes are required on the Kafka consumer side, since the compression information is made available in the message header and the consumer can automagically uncompress these and make it available for processing.

It's like having a assistant that not only speeds up your work but also checks for errors with each update, ensuring your WordPress site runs smoothly. This constant testing and feedback loop means you can fix bugs quickly and improve your site continuously without disrupting the live version. In short, CI/CD makes your development process faster, more efficient, and less error prone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is a staging site?
A staging site, also called as a development site, testing site, or sandbox – is a clone of your actual WordPress website which cannot be accessed by your visitors. This can only be accessed by people who have the staging URL.
 
Why do you need a staging site for your WordPress website?
A staging site is extremely useful when you are working on a WordPress website. It provides a safe area for development, testing, and experimentation. When you are trying out a new plugin, theme or custom code, there are chances that the website might break leading to downtime for your users, or even cause irreparable damage to your website like loss of content and data.
Users would not be able to see your work in progress. You can make the changes live when you are ready. A staging …]]></summary>

Why should we care about the safety of our chat service?
 
When you deploy a chat service on a website, users may enter inappropriate or harmful messages that can lead to unwanted responses from the chatbot. This can pose significant risks, including the potential for revealing sensitive company information or allowing other users' messages to influence the chatbot's responses. That's why it's critical to implement a content filtering mechanism that can inspect messages from users. Azure Content Safety provides a robust solution for inspecting and filtering inappropriate content, ensuring safe and secure interactions.

The recent advances in LLMs have created opportunities for businesses to gain new insight into their unstructured text data. A classic example of this has been using the popular Retrieval Augmented Generation pattern (e.g. https://github.com/Azure/GPT-RAG) in which enterprise documents are used as context to answer user questions. These implementations can reduce time spent sifting through lengthy documentation and promote awareness throughout an organization.
 
But what about using LLMs to extract insights from structured relational data such as SQL databases? Many enterprises possess enormous amounts of SQL data that currently requires technical expertise to query or build business dashboards to make this data accessible to end users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, and welcome to the recap of our latest video on AI and .NET.
 
In this video, we talked about some of the exciting projects and samples that we have been working on to help you get started with AI using .NET. We also answered some of the questions that you asked us in the previous episode, such as:

How to work with local models
How to use semantic kernel
How to evaluate different models.

 
One of the main topics that we discussed was the AI samples repo, where we are adding artificial intelligence samples for .NET developers. You can find scenarios such as text summarization, chat, data generation, image generation, and more. You can also choose between using semantic kernel or the Azure Open AI SDK to interact with the models.
 
We also showed you how to switch between different models, such as GPT-4, Phi-3 and Llama, using the same code and API. We also shared some links to other resources, such as the Azure Developer .NET Day, where you can learn more about AI, GitHub Copilot, SQL Server, and other topics.
 
Another topic that we covered was the model evaluation sample, which is a work in progress that we are going to present at Build 2024.  (you can check the PR here). The idea behind this sample is to help you evaluate different models that you may want to use or fine-tune for your own applications. We showed you how to use a console application that uses semantic kernel to generate questions and answers, user stories, and other inputs, and then evaluate them using different metrics, such as coherence, groundedness, relevance, and length.
 
The full recording is here,

Performance testing is not always a walk in the park. Quite often, it can be challenging and time-consuming, especially when dealing with complex and dynamic web applications that rely on JavaScript, AJAX, or other browser-side technologies.
For testing browser latencies under heavy load, JMeter has a built-in component called Web Driver Sampler, which allows testers to use Selenium WebDriver to simulate real browser actions and interactions with web elements. Web Driver Sampler can complement the HTTP Request Sampler, which sends HTTP requests to the server, by adding the browser-side perspective and measuring the rendering time, page load time, and user actions. By running JMeter scripts on Azure Load Testing, you can reliably execute your performance tests without worrying …]]></summary>

What the heck am I talking about? Let me bring you up to speed very quickly (attention, oversimplification ahead!): NSG Flow Logs is a technology that logs every packet going through an NSG: in and out, allowed and dropped. The main issue of NSG Flow Logs is, well, that you need an NSG, and some resources in Azure do not support them. For example, Azure Firewall, VPN gateways or ExpressRoute gateways. Enter VNet Flow Logs, which you can enable in a whole VNet or subnet, regardless of whether there…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
Containerization has become the prevailing choice for hosting and managing Java applications, due to its unmatched portability, consistency, and scalability benefits. However, by default, when running a Java app inside containers, the JVM assumes that the OS memory is shared among multiple applications, so it conservatively claims memory for the Java application.
With Azure Container Apps, we can optimize memory allocation by simply dedicating more memory to the Java app, since only one Java application can run inside a container. This feature is called automatic memory fit, which is enabled by default when you deploy from Java source code or artifact.
In this blog we’ll cover the following:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
Redis is an extremely popular in-memory data store that is used as a cache, session store, message broker, and more. One of the features that makes Redis really useful is the ability to set a time-to-live (TTL) value for any key. A key with a TTL value will be automatically deleted from Redis when the TTL expires. This helps reduce memory usage and ensure data freshness.
 
For instance, you might be storing information like inventory or pricing for your e-commerce site in Redis. This is a perfect application for caching in Redis. This type of data will be queried constantly and serving it directly from a database will either slow down your application or make your database implementation very expensive to handle the load! Using a CDN is out of the question because pricing and …]]></summary>

There are a lot of considerations one must deal with while planning, deploying and using these connections such as which identity do I use, what network configurations do I implement and where do I storage the connection configuration either in key vault or in App Configuration service to name a few.
Following these practices is important to ensure that as a developer you play your part in not just implementing best practices but also align with azure security baseline and the concept of zero trust.
This is where a service connection can help simplify some of these design and implementation choices for you.

What is it
When a user authenticates to an app (e.g., MS Entra ID application), a custom claims provider can be used to add claims into the token. A custom claims provider is made up of a custom authentication extension that calls an external REST API (e.g., a Function App), to fetch claims from external systems (e.g., a Database). A custom claims provider can be assigned to one or many applications.
 
Claim: Please imagine it as features (or attributes) that belong to the end user. As it may involve sensitive information within the enterprise, the enterprise owner wishes to store this user information in the on-premises environment, while also hoping to retrieve and utilize it through the authentication process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Azure Monitor and App Service teams are happy to share that Application Insights integration with App Services for Python apps is now available for Public Preview. You can now easily monitor your Python apps on App Service without changing your code by leveraging auto-instrumentation that is integrated into the App Services platform.
 
This integration supports App Service deploy as code for Python versions 3.11 and lower. Deploy as container scenarios are not currently supported, but we plan to introduce this capability at a future date. We also plan to support Python 3.12 in the near future.
 
With this feature enabled, the App Service platform will instrument popular Python libraries in your code and automatically channel correlated application-level logs, metrics, and distributed tracing to your Application Insights resource. This will allow you to understand how your Python application is performing and more easily determine the cause of any incidents.
 
You can enable the feature at resource creation or from the App Insights blade after your App Service resource is created. Please review our documentation to learn more.
 
Turn On App Insights during App Service Resource Creation
 
When you create a new Python web application (version 3.11 and lower) using the "Deploy as code" option, you can select "Yes" on the "Enable Application Insights" in the "Monitoring" tab. If you select "Yes", then your non-containerized Python application will pipe data to an Application Insights resource allowing you to automatically monitor your workloads.
 

 
 
Turn On App Insights after App Service Resource Creation
 
Open your App Service application in the portal and go to the App Insights menu item.

Select "Enable" in the toggle under "Application Insights (Preview)"
Select a location for your Application Insights resource (It’s suggested to create the resource in the same region as the Web App.)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fabric Multi-Tenant Architecture
ISVs often face challenges in managing data for multiple tenants in a secure manner while keeping costs low. Traditional solutions may prove costly for scenarios with more than 100 tenants, especially with the common ISV scenario where the volume of trial and free tenants is much larger than the volume of paying tenants.
The motivation for ISVs to use Fabric is that it brings together experiences such as Data Engineering, Data Factory, Data Science, Data Warehouse, Real-Time Analytics, and Power BI onto a shared SaaS foundation.
In this article, we will explore the Workspace per tenant-based architecture, which is a cost-effective solution for managing data for all tenants in Microsoft Fabric, including ETL and reporting.

Our host, David Blank-Edelman and our armchair architects Uli Homann and Eric Charran will be discussing how to choose a Large Language Model (LLM) partner.  Architects and developers are often at a crossroads: should they use existing AI models or venture into building their own? This decision is far from trivial, as it comes with a myriad of considerations, from return on investment to the rapid pace of AI commoditization.
 
What are the processes and criteria you should consider when choosing a LLM or a foundational model (FM) for your AI project, and are the trade-offs between building your own model or using a hosted service? What are some of the challenges of trusting and validating the outputs of LLMs and FMs?  When choosing an LLM partner, what things should you think …]]></summary>

A low-code solution without having to write and deploy apps or web services
Easy and secure integration with other Azure resources with Managed Identities
Features which aid in parameterization making a single data factory reuseable for many different scenarios (for example, an insurance company could use the same data factory to analyze videos or images for car damage as well as for fire damage, storm damage, etc. )

This article describes how to copy all Azure Storage Queues data between two different storage accounts.
 
For this, we will use Azure Storage SDK for Python to copy all queues (and the respective data) from one Azure Storage Queue to another Azure Storage Queue. This approach will keep the data in the source queues, and will create new queues with the respective data in the destination Azure Storage Queue.

They are using Azure Function App as the external source. As this setup demands, they exposed Azure Function App over public IP to work with B2C. But due to enterprise security restriction policy they must remove public endpoint from Function App and use private endpoints to VNET.
 
They thought of 2 options to expose the Function App securely over internet – using Azure API Management instance to a virtual network - external mode APIM in external mode or using Azure Application Gateway. But in both the cases B2C auth process errors out after adding the API Connector in the user flow:

Well, personally I'm more of a backend guy, but when I'm the end-user of a web app I like that it is intuitive, dynamic and all of that. Unfortunately while there's nothing inherently wrong with a server-side MVC-style web app often these requirements lead to coding client-side components because that offers more flexibility.
 
And what have we all learned about browser clients? They cannot be trusted to keep secrets or guarantee their integrity. (Which is why you also see server side frontend components.) My intent is not to devolve into arguments around which frameworks are better or all the knobs and levers that can be tweaked to make it right.

One of the ways to optimize cost and performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is to cache the responses from LLMs, this is sometimes referred to as “semantic caching”. In this blog, we will discuss the approaches, benefits, common scenarios and key considerations for using semantic caching.
 
What is semantic caching?
Caching systems typically store commonly retrieved data for subsequent serving in an optimal manner. In the context of LLMs, semantic cache maintains a cache of previously asked questions and responses, uses similarity measures to retrieve semantically similar queries from the cache and respond with cached responses if a match is found within the threshold for similarity. If cache is not able to return a response, then the answer can be returned from a fresh L…]]></summary>

Refactoring with GitHub Copilot
In the example, Bruno takes classic "for" loop using a numerical index and refactors it to use a "foreach" loop. In general, I also prefer to use "foreach" loops in .NET as I feel that they are more readable than the more classic "for" syntax.

Bridging the Gap: An Idea Takes Shape
Bletchley Park AI Microsoft User Group was born out of a simple idea: to fill a gap in our local tech community. As tech enthusiasts and professionals, we noticed that there was a need for a space where people could come together to discuss the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and share their thoughts on responsible AI practices.
Milton Keynes is a leading tech hub in the UK, and was without a user group for any of the Microsoft technologies, and hence there was a need for a space that like minded community heroes and leaders could come together using.

Two key concepts that are typically either planned late or addressed reactively in transformation projects are: 1. Cutover strategy, and 2. Planning the migration of middleware while also reusing the middleware solutions for both one-time migrations and for near-real-time integrations. Having these plans in place makes the changeover more seamless, with little or no impact on the systems’ functioning taking into consideration the time period between the end of the on-premises (or legacy) system and the beginning of the cloud (or modern) system.

In previous posts I shared how to host and chat with a Llama 2 model hosted locally with Ollama. (view post). And then, it was time to learn how to integrate Semantic Kernel with OllamaSharp (nuget package and repo).
 
OllamaSharp is a .NET binding for the Ollama API, making it easy to interact with Ollama using your favorite .NET languages.
 
So, I decided to try it, and create a Chat Completion and a Text Generation specific implementation for Semantic Kernel using this library.
The full test is a console app using both services with Semantic Kernel.

The Text Generation Service is an easy one. Just implement the interface Microsoft.SemanticKernel.TextGeneration.ITextGenerationService, and the generated code looks like this:

Over the years, Azure Cloud Services (classic) has played a central role in Microsoft’s cloud offerings. However, as technology advances, there arises a demand for more sophisticated and efficient services. To address this, Microsoft has introduced Azure Cloud Services (extended support) as a successor to the classic model. It provides comparable functionality while adding extra benefits and features. This transition is essential for businesses to remain current with technology, enhance their cloud management capabilities, and be well-prepared for the future.
Cloud Services (extended support) is a highly anticipated and essential platform enhancement for Azure early adopter customers who are transitioning to Azure Resource Manager (ARM).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this blog, our host, David Blank-Edelman and our armchair architects Uli Homann and Eric Charran will be delving into the significance of establishing an AI charter for organizations venturing into AI. They will talk about the importance of an AI charter, and what should be included. Spoiler alert: the short answer is “yes” AI charters are valuable. The conversation starting an AI charter was included in a previous blog Armchair Architects: Considerations for Ethical and Responsible Use of AI in Applications. Uli brought up the need for an AI charter in the previous blog and he will provide some insights into why it is needed.

Customers have modernized their data warehouse by hosting it on Snowflake (in AWS) and have chosen Power BI (in Azure) as their single reporting/analytics platform. They used to have multiple reporting/analytics platforms like QlikView, Tableau & Power BI, but consolidating them on one platform has made operations & management easier. This architecture has also led to performance challenges and rising costs of Snowflake and Power BI and also prohibited them from implementing Self Data Service.  Customers are looking to reduce costs for Power BI and Snowflake and solve some of the architectural issues in offering self-data service for business users.
 
Some of the challenges identified are as below.

In this article we will see how to benefit from the advantages of two infrastructure and template management solutions: Helm charts and Terraform.
 
In order to make the exercise challenging and to prove that the use of these two features works well, I deliberately chose to use the SecretProviderClass because it is a complex Kubernetes resource type to model.
 
For more details on the SecretProviderClass, please consult the following article that points out how to create a SecretProviderClass using user-assigned identity to access your key vault.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
 
In this article we will see how to benefit from the advantages of two infrastructure and template management solutions: Helm charts and Terraform.
 
In order to make the exercise challenging and to prove that the use of these two features works well, I deliberately chose to use the SecretProviderClass because it is a complex Kubernetes resource type to model.
 
For more details on the SecretProviderClass, please consult the following article that points out how to create a SecretProviderClass using user-assigned identity to access your key vault.
 

 
 
 

All the code used in this article is available here on GitHub: JamesDLD/terraform-azurerm_kubernetes-helm-chart-SecretProviderClass

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Effective cost management in Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics is essential for controlling cloud expenditures. It involves strategic measures to reduce costs while maximizing the value derived from ingested, processed, and retained data. In Azure, achieving this balance entails adopting efficient data ingestion methods, smart retention policies, and judicious use of table transformations with Kusto Query Language (KQL).
Understanding the impact of data management practices on costs is crucial since each byte of data ingested and stored in Azure Log Analytics incurs expenses. Table transformations—such as filtering, projecting, aggregating, sorting, joining, and dropping data—are a great way to reduce storage and ingestion costs.  They allow you to filter or modify data before it’s sen…]]></summary>

This solution guide presents a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models, such as ChatGPT, to address the limitations found in traditional recommendation methods. Traditional methods are typically task-specific and therefore require corresponding data to train distinct models for various applications. These methods often lack generalization capabilities and underperform in cold start situations. To overcome these challenges, we propose and implement an ecommerce recommender system based on ChatGPT. This system is specifically designed for recommendation systems in scenarios with limited task-specific data, for example, cold start problem that often associates with new users. The "cold start problem" is a term commonly used in the context of recommendatio…]]></summary>

In that post, we outlined a plan to stagger the .NET 8 releases, with support first coming to the isolated worker model, and the in-process model option coming a bit later. This is still the plan, and in this post, we wanted to discuss a bit more about how things will work once the option is available.
 
How the in-process model option for .NET 8 will work
One key difference between this and previous .NET version changes for the in-process model is that it will be an update solely focused on enabling .NET 8 support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure provides a comprehensive list of built-in policy definitions (grouped by the category property defined in the metadata) which are owned and maintained by Microsoft (where the azure-policy repository contains the direct representation of these).
 
Built-in policy definitions usually cover a specific scenario although some flexibility might be provided through parameters that can be configured. However, customers might have specific needs not covered by an available built-in policy definition and a custom policy definition might be needed.
 
As a rule of thumb, if there is a built-in policy definition that covers part of a scenario, a custom policy definition can be created based on it introducing the necessary modifications.
 
Let’s take into consideration the [Preview]: Assign Built-In User-Assigned Managed Identity to Virtual Machines built-in policy definition that creates and assigns a built-in user-assigned managed identity or assigns a pre-created user-assigned managed identity at scale to virtual machines. This currently provides the user-assigned managed identity name and resource group name as parameters expecting that it is on the same subscription as the virtual machine resource. However, in a scenario where the pre-created user-assigned managed identity exists in a different subscription from the virtual machine resource, a custom policy definition is required.
 
Before creating a custom policy, it is worth checking both the Azure Policy Samples as well as the Community Policy Repository to see whether a policy definition that matches your needs already exists. Coming back to the user-assigned managed identity assignment to virtual machines where the pre-created user-assigned managed identity exists in a different subscription from the virtual machine resource scenario, a custom policy definition is available here where the user assigned managed identity resource URI (which contains the subscription ID) is provided as a parameter.]]></summary>

Here, I wanted to discuss possible scenarios and examples on how this can be used to check the availability for services across Azure and even on Azure Arc enabled resources.
 
Azure Resource Graph queries
Azure Resource Graph is a service within Azure that enhances Azure Resource Management. It allows you to explore resources efficiently and quickly by running queries across a specific group of subscriptions. These queries are written in the Kusto Query Language (KQL), which is a widely used format with other Azure services like Log Analytics.
 
Trivia: Most of the screens you see on Azure portal give you an option to check the KQL query behind getting that data.

This distributed microservices architecture allows multiple teams within large organizations to operate independently of each other and release new versions of their microservices at their own cadence. However, this requires an additional level of supervision to address observability, traffic management, and security use cases for service-to-service communication across these distributed workloads. This can be done by embedding logic directly within the application code of each microservice, or it can be done in a transparent way using service mesh which deploys sidecars to application pods to achieve the same use cases…]]></summary>

By default, pgvector performs exact nearest neighbor search, calculating the similarity between the query vector and every vector in the database. While this type of search provides perfect recall, it often leads to longer search times. To enhance efficiency for large datasets, you should create indexes to enable approximate nearest neighbor search, which trades off result quality for speed. Pgvector supports two types of approximate indexes:

        <updated>2024-03-19T00:52:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft is looking to enable TLS 1.3 for Azure Service Bus, and Azure Event Hubs.  We found however that there is a problem with some clients that use both Java and our AMQP or JMS interfaces.  Java clients that use Apache Proton-J with a version older than proton-j-0.31.0 along with Java 11+ can't support TLS 1.3.  The Proton-J library is used in AMQP and JMS implementations. The nature of the problem lies in the handshake and is thus not detectable by our application layer.  This means that we can't detect and work around the issue from the service side.  To avoid this problem, customers need to update any instances of Apache Proton-J that have a version older than proton-j-0.31.0.  The link for the Proton-J issue is tracked at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PROTON-1972
 
Required action
Proton-J may also be in a dependent library and may not be directly used by your code. To determine if you have an incompatibility with TLS 1.3, we have enabled the West Central US region with TLS 1.3 support for AMQP traffic.  To test if you have a compatibility issue

first evaluate if you are using AMQP or JMS
Second, determine if you are using Java 11+ with your client code
Third, if you are using AMQP or JMS and also Java 11+, then create a namespace in West Central US and attempt to connect to it with your code. 

If your client fails to connect, you need to find where you are using Proton-J and get the version used updated to a version that is newer than proton-j-0.30.0.
 
Timeline
As already noted, this only affects AMQP or JMS traffic.  It does not affect web service or Kafka traffic which does have TLS 1.3 enabled now.  We are going to enable TLS 1.3 for AMQP and JMS on October 31, 2024.  That is also the same day that TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 is being removed from Azure Event Hubs and Azure Service Bus.  Please take action as soon as possible to guarantee no interruption to your service use when we enable TLS 1.3.]]></summary>

I was just a student getting started with backend development. I had some basic knowledge of working with Restful APIs.

The Low Code February Challenge was covering various topics ie

Why Low-Code?
Start low coding with Microsoft!
What is Fusion Development and why is it important?
PnP connectors

The infrastructure layer of Azure Event Hubs is being upgraded which will cause the IP addresses used by customer namespaces to change. These changes are being made as part of our continuous improvements to our platform. The IP addresses of our services can change and should not be considered static and unchanging. The changes being made will not alter billing or cause any service interruptions.  
 
Call to Action 
If you are using IP addresses in your egress firewalls to your Azure Event Hubs namespaces, you will need to configure your firewalls to use the fully qualified domain names for your specific namespaces, or the wildcard “*.servicebus.windows.net” domains. These will automatically resolve to the new IP addresses.]]></summary>

PII can pose risks to both the data subjects and the data holders and can introduce security breach vulnerability, privacy violations or biases that affect the decisions made based on the data. For example, if a source data contains PII in a generative AI application, there's a risk of confidential information such as a bank account information to be returned from a user's prompt inquiry.  One way to protect PII is to use responsible AI, which is a set of principles and practices that help to mask PII with synthetic or anonymized data …]]></summary>

This method enhances security by avoiding the need to store credentials in code or configuration files. If you are interested in connecting to an Azure SQL database from a Python Function App using managed identity, you can find a related post here.
Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides a secure store for secrets, keys, and certificates. With managed identities for Azure resources, you can authenticate to services that support Azure AD authentication without needing credentials in your code.
Let's dive into the steps to achieve this with a Python App Service.
