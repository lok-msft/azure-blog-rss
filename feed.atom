        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Transitional approaches in Cloud Transformations: Cutover planning and the role of middleware
 
Two key concepts that are typically either planned late or addressed reactively in transformation projects are: 1. Cutover strategy, and 2. Planning the migration of middleware while also reusing the middleware solutions for both one-time migrations and for near-real-time integrations. Having these plans in place makes the changeover more seamless, with little or no impact on the systems’ functioning taking into consideration the time period between the end of the on-premises (or legacy) system and the beginning of the cloud (or modern) system.
Cloud Transformations require transition planning to cutover applications, databases, middleware, users, administrators, and other stakeholders to the ap…]]></summary>

They we will dive deeper into the meaning of “what is responsible AI?” and what it entails. It sounds like a cool concept, but let’s have the armchair architects share their views on it as it may not necessarily be well understood.
 
Genesis of Responsible AI
From Uli’s perspective, responsible AI came out of the initial usage of algorithms to make decisions based on mostly statistics and machine learning capabilities. There was a credit card decision example using AI and data he provided in Armchair Ar…]]></summary>

In previous posts I shared how to host and chat with a Llama 2 model hosted locally with Ollama. (view post). And then, it was time to learn how to integrate Semantic Kernel with OllamaSharp (nuget package and repo).
 
OllamaSharp is a .NET binding for the Ollama API, making it easy to interact with Ollama using your favorite .NET languages.
 
So, I decided to try it, and create a Chat Completion and a Text Generation specific implementation for Semantic Kernel using this library.
The full test is a console app using both services with Semantic Kernel.
 

Text Generation Service
The Text Generation Service is an easy one. Just implement the interface Microsoft.SemanticKernel.TextGeneration.ITextGenerationService, and the generated code looks like this:

Over the years, Azure Cloud Services (classic) has played a central role in Microsoft’s cloud offerings. However, as technology advances, there arises a demand for more sophisticated and efficient services. To address this, Microsoft has introduced Azure Cloud Services (extended support) as a successor to the classic model. It provides comparable functionality while adding extra benefits and features. This transition is essential for businesses to remain current with technology, enhance their cloud management capabilities, and be well-prepared for the future.
Cloud Services (extended support) is a highly anticipated and essential platform enhancement for Azure early adopter customers who are transitioning to Azure Resource Manager (ARM).

Customers have modernized their data warehouse by hosting it on Snowflake (in AWS) and have chosen Power BI (in Azure) as their single reporting/analytics platform. They used to have multiple reporting/analytics platforms like QlikView, Tableau & Power BI, but consolidating them on one platform has made operations & management easier. This architecture has also led to performance challenges and rising costs of Snowflake and Power BI and also prohibited them from implementing Self Data Service.  Customers are looking to reduce costs for Power BI and Snowflake and solve some of the architectural issues in offering self-data service for business users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Effective cost management in Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics is essential for controlling cloud expenditures. It involves strategic measures to reduce costs while maximizing the value derived from ingested, processed, and retained data. In Azure, achieving this balance entails adopting efficient data ingestion methods, smart retention policies, and judicious use of table transformations with Kusto Query Language (KQL).
Understanding the impact of data management practices on costs is crucial since each byte of data ingested and stored in Azure Log Analytics incurs expenses. Table transformations—such as filtering, projecting, aggregating, sorting, joining, and dropping data—are a great way to reduce storage and ingestion costs.  They allow you to filter or modify data before it’s sen…]]></summary>

To overcome these challenges, we propose and implement an ecommerce recommender system based on ChatGPT.

One key difference between this and previous .NET version changes for the in-process model is that it will be an update solely focused on enabling .NET 8 support. There will be no additional Functions-specific breaking changes from the latest host version for .NET 6 that your project would…]]></summary>

Planned maintenance events are periodic updates made by Microsoft to the underlying Azure platform. Most of these updates are totally transparent to customers. However, some maintenance may result in brief freezes or performances degradation, and on very rare occasions, a reboot might be required.

In many industries, information can be scattered across multiple documents, or across multiple pages in a very large document. Moreover, combining information across documents and sources is essential for day-to-day operations. In many industries (Legal, Insurance, Medical), information is spread across the documents in the form of Names Entities (E.g. - Address, Phone number, Policy Name etc.) that can be linked to each other through “Relationships”. Manually identifying entities and relationships across thousands of documents can be costly and time intensive. In this document, we go through the process of automating named entity recognition and identifying relationships through knowledge graphs.

Built-in policy definitions usually cover a specific scenario although some flexibility might be provided through parameters that can be configured. However, customers might have specific needs not covered by an available built-in policy definition and a custom policy definition might be needed.
 
As a rule of thumb, if there is a built-in policy definition that covers part of a scenario, a custom policy definition can be created based on it introducing the necessary modifications.
 
Let’s take into consideration the [Preview]: Assign Built-In User-Assigned Managed Identity to Virtual Machines built-in policy definition that creates and assigns a built-in user-assigned managed identity or assigns a pre-created user-assigned managed identity at scale to virtual machines. This currently provides the user-assigned managed identity name and resource group name as parameters expecting that it is on the same subscription as the virtual machine resource. However, in a scenario where the pre-created user-assigned managed identity exists in a different subscription from the virtual machine resource, a custom policy definition is required.
 
Before creating a custom policy, it is worth checking both the Azure Policy Samples as well as the Community Policy Repository to see whether a policy definition that matches your needs already exists. Coming back to the user-assigned managed identity assignment to virtual machines where the pre-created user-assigned managed identity exists in a different subscription from the virtual machine resource scenario, a custom policy definition is available here where the user assigned managed identity resource URI (which contains the subscription ID) is provided as a parameter.]]></summary>

Azure Resource Graph queries
Azure Resource Graph is a service within Azure that enhances Azure Resource Management. It allows you to explore resources efficiently and quickly by running queries across a specific group of subscriptions. These queries are written in the Kusto Query Language (KQL), which is a widely used format with other Azure services like Log Analytics.
 
Trivia: Most of the screens you see on Azure portal give you an option to check the KQL query behind getting that data.

This distributed microservices architecture allows multiple teams within large organizations to operate independently of each other and release new versions of their microservices at their own cadence. However, this requires an additional level of supervision to address observability, traffic management, and security use cases for service-to-service communication across these distributed workloads. This can be done by embedding logic directly within the application code of each microservice, or it can be done in a transparent way using service mesh which deploys sidecars to application pods to achieve the same use cases…]]></summary>

By default, pgvector performs exact nearest neighbor search, calculating the similarity between the query vector and every vector in the database. While this type of search provides perfect recall, it often leads to longer search times. To enhance efficiency for large datasets, you should create indexes to enable approximate nearest neighbor search, which trades off result quality for speed. Pgvector supports two types of approximate indexes:

        <updated>2024-03-19T00:52:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft is looking to enable TLS 1.3 for Azure Service Bus, and Azure Event Hubs.  We found however that there is a problem with some clients that use both Java and our AMQP or JMS interfaces.  Java clients that use Apache Proton-J with a version older than proton-j-0.31.0 along with Java 11+ can't support TLS 1.3.  The Proton-J library is used in AMQP and JMS implementations. The nature of the problem lies in the handshake and is thus not detectable by our application layer.  This means that we can't detect and work around the issue from the service side.  To avoid this problem, customers need to update any instances of Apache Proton-J that have a version older than proton-j-0.31.0.  The link for the Proton-J issue is tracked at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PROTON-1972
 
Required action
Proton-J may also be in a dependent library and may not be directly used by your code. To determine if you have an incompatibility with TLS 1.3, we have enabled the West Central US region with TLS 1.3 support for AMQP traffic.  To test if you have a compatibility issue

first evaluate if you are using AMQP or JMS
Second, determine if you are using Java 11+ with your client code
Third, if you are using AMQP or JMS and also Java 11+, then create a namespace in West Central US and attempt to connect to it with your code. 

If your client fails to connect, you need to find where you are using Proton-J and get the version used updated to a version that is newer than proton-j-0.30.0.
 
Timeline
As already noted, this only affects AMQP or JMS traffic.  It does not affect web service or Kafka traffic which does have TLS 1.3 enabled now.  We are going to enable TLS 1.3 for AMQP and JMS on October 31, 2024.  That is also the same day that TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 is being removed from Azure Event Hubs and Azure Service Bus.  Please take action as soon as possible to guarantee no interruption to your service use when we enable TLS 1.3.]]></summary>

The infrastructure layer of Azure Event Hubs is being upgraded which will cause the IP addresses used by customer namespaces to change. These changes are being made as part of our continuous improvements to our platform. The IP addresses of our services can change and should not be considered static and unchanging. The changes being made will not alter billing or cause any service interruptions.  
 
Call to Action 
If you are using IP addresses in your egress firewalls to your Azure Event Hubs namespaces, you will need to configure your firewalls to use the fully qualified domain names for your specific namespaces, or the wildcard “*.servicebus.windows.net” domains. These will automatically resolve to the new IP addresses.]]></summary>

PII can pose risks to both the data subjects and the data holders and can introduce security breach vulnerability, privacy violations or biases that affect the decisions made based on the data. For example, if a source data contains PII in a generative AI application, there's a risk of confidential information such as a bank account information to be returned from a user's prompt inquiry.  One way to protect PII is to use responsible AI, which is a set of principles and practices that help to mask PII with synthetic or anonymized data …]]></summary>

Azure Container Apps (ACA) provides a flexible and scalable platform for deploying containerized applications. One powerful feature it offers is the ability to customize startup commands and override default CMD or ENTRYPOINT defined in a Dockerfile. In this blog, we'll explore how to leverage the "Command Override" option using various methods in ACA and Container App Jobs.
 
Understanding Command Overrides
Command overrides come in handy when you need to execute specific CMD or change the ENTRYPOINT of your container at runtime.
 
Example:
If one wants to run "index.js" during the start of the app, but as per line number 14 in below image, the "server.js" file will execute.

It can be achieved by providing "node", "index.js" to Command Override field in ACA, in easy words, t…]]></summary>

We write tests, like unit tests, integration tests, smoke tests, accessibility tests, loadtests, property-based tests. We can’t automate all forms of testing, so we test what we can, and hire humans to audit what we can’t.
 
But when we’re building RAG chat apps built on LLMs, we need to introduce an entirely new form of testing to give us confidence that our LLM responses are coherent, grounded, and well-formed.
 
We call this form of testing “evaluation”, and we can now automate it with the help of the most powerful LLM in town: GPT-4.

As an architect Eric worries about a couple main areas in the AI space. First there are ethical and responsible considerations for architects integrating LLMs into any type of design, collaboration, or application experience.

Understanding the Challenge:
 
Node.js applications are confined by a default memory limit set by the runtime environment. This can be a bottleneck for memory-intensive applications. Fortunately, Node.js provides a solution by allowing developers to increase this fixed memory limit, paving the way for improved performance.

The app receives a user question, uses the user question to search a knowledge base, then sends the question and matching bits of information to the LLM, instructing the LLM to adhere to the sources.
 
That's the most straightforward RAG approach, but as it turns out, it's not what quite what we do in our most popular open-source RAG solution, azure-search-openai-demo.
 
The flow instead looks like this:

After the app receives a user question, it makes an initial call to an LLM to turn that user question into a more appropriate search query for Azure AI search. More generally, you can think of this step as turning the user query into a datastore-aware query. This a…]]></summary>

The count of records in the indexer and the index did not align even after activating the change detection policy. Even with record deletions, the entries persisted in the Index Search Explorer.
 
To enable incremental indexing, configure the "dataChangeDetectionPolicy" property within your data source definition. This setting informs the indexer about the specific change tracking mechanism employed by your table or view.
 
For Azure SQL indexers, you can choose the change detection policy below:
"SqlIntegratedChangeTrackingPolicy" (applicable to tables exclusively)
It is recommended using "SqlIntegratedChangeTrackingPolicy" for its efficiency and its ability to identify deleted rows.

However, realizing those savings requires diligence to proactively plan, govern, and monitor your cloud solutions. Your ability to detect, analyze, and quickly resolve unexpected costs can help minimize the impact on your budget and operations. When you understand your cloud costs you can make more informed decisions on how to allocate and manage those costs. But even with proactive cost management, surprises can still happen. That’s why we developed several tools in Microsoft Cost Management to help you set up thresholds and rules so you can detect problems early and ensure the timely detection of out-of-scope changes in your cloud costs. Let’s take a closer look at some of these tools and how you …]]></summary>

Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker that allows you to connect, decouple, and exchange messages between different applications and services. It supports a range of communication patterns, such as queues, topics, and event hubs, and enables reliable and secure message delivery at scale.
However, to ensure that your Azure Service Bus solution can handle the expected load and performance requirements, you need to conduct load testing and measure the throughput, latency, and resource utilization of your system under various scenarios. Load testing can help you identify and resolve any bottlenecks, errors, or failures that might occur when your system is under stress.

Today, we launched our refreshed guidance for identity and access management (IAM) in Azure Landing Zones. ALZ is a core part of the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure. It is aligned to the eight CAF design areas, Identity and Access Management being one of them. You can check out the refreshed guidance over at: aka.ms/ALZ/IAM
 
The updated guidance brings IAM to the heart of a robust Azure Landing Zones implementation. ALZ is built to support a Zero Trust strategy, and the guidance is centred around the principle of least privilege to ensure that every administrator and user has the access they need, when they need it, to the right resources, and nothing more. No single administrator or team should have superpowers over everything. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Changing? 
The infrastructure layer of Azure Relay and Service Bus is being upgraded which will cause the IP addresses used by customer namespaces to. For Azure Relay the gateway DNS names are also changing.
 
These changes are being made as part of our continuous improvements to our platform. The IP addresses of our services can change and should not be considered static and unchanging as previously communicated in the communication for Azure Service Bus and Azure Relay.  There is no added charge for this nor are there any service interruptions during the migration.
 
Call to Action 
If you are using IP addresses in your egress firewalls to your Azure Relay or Azure Service Bus namespaces, you will need to update them to use the namespace DNS names instead. 
 
Azure Service Bus customers
For Azure Service Bus, configure your firewalls to use the fully qualified domain names for your specific namespaces, or the wildcard “*.servicebus.windows.net” domains. These will automatically resolve to the new IP addresses.
 
Azure Relay customers
For Azure Relay, configure your firewalls with the DNS names of all the Relay gateways, which can be found by running this script . This script will resolve the fully qualified domain names of all the gateways to which you need to establish a connection.
Change any rules that previously used the IP addresses to use the namespace DNS name for port 80/443 traffic and the gateway DNS names where you previously were using IP addresses.  WCF uses a number of ports beyond 80/443 including 9351, 9350, 5671, 9352, and 9353 so be sure to check, where you have firewall rules for those ports.]]></summary>

There are business and/or technical cases where relational data should be duplicated to another environment. Since the demands of those business and/or technical cases are not the same, there are multiple technical solutions to achieve the goal.
In this article, I will discuss of the various solutions according to difference business needs, with deep dive into one family of solutions – sync solutions that is based on the database engine (DB engine). The content is Azure oriented, but the same concepts are true for other clouds as well.I would expect that anyone that needs to sync relational data between environment can find here a good guideline.

What are vector databases?
Eric defines vector databases as a way in which we store meaningful information about multi-dimensional aspects of data such as what's called vectors, which are numerical, typically numerical integers which work very much like a traditional relational database system.
 
What's interesting about the vector databases is that they help us solve different types of queries. One type of query is like a “nearest neighbor”.

How do you manage the lifecycle of those APIs?
What governance would you apply to these APIs?
What is the list of environments needed to manage these APIs?
What are the deployment strategies for those APIs?
How would you integrate those APIs with other services?

 
As your company's number of APIs increases, so does the complexity of managing them. Azure API Center (APIC) is a central repository for your APIs lifecycle management, and it offers the more efficient ways for management. Throughout this post, I will take a first look at what Azure API Center is and what it offers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the previous series of articles, we learned about the basic concepts of AI agents and how to use AutoGen or Semantic Kernel combined with the Azure OpenAI Service Assistant API to build AI agent applications. For different scenarios and workflows, powerful tools need to be assembled to support the operation of the AI agent. If you only use your own tool chain in the AI agent framework to solve enterprise workflow, it will be very limited. AutoGen supports defining tool chains through Function Calling, and developers can define different methods to assemble extended business work chains. As mentioned before, Semantic Kernel has good business-based plug-in creation, management and engineering capabilities. Through AutoGen + Semantic Kernel, powerful AI agent solutions can be built.

A global enterprise wants to migrate thousands of Nutanix AHV or VMware vSphere virtual machines (VMs) to Microsoft Azure as part of their application modernization strategy. The first step is to exit their on-premises data centers and rapidly relocate their legacy application VMs to the Nutanix Cloud Clusters on Azure (NC2 on Azure) service as a staging area for the first phase of their modernization strategy. How can they quickly size NC2 on Azure to meet their workload requirements?
 
NC2 on Azure is a third-party Azure service from Nutanix that provides private clouds containing Nutanix AHV clusters built from dedicated bare-metal Azure infrastructure.

This blog will mainly focus on providing an example about how to recreate the Batch pool with required user assigned Managed Identity and Key Vault extension. Currently the Batch pool with user assigned Managed Identity and extension is only supported by ARM template and REST API call. Creating a pool with extension is unsupported in Azure Portal.

It’s time to go back to AI and NET, so today’s post is a small demo on how to run a LLM (large language model, this demo using Phi-2) in local mode, and how to interact with the model using Semantic Kernel.
 
LM Studio
I’ve tested several products and libraries to run LLMs locally, and LM Studio is on my top 3. LM Studio is a desktop application that allows you to run open-source models locally on your computer. You can use LM Studio to discover, download, and chat with models from Hugging Face, or create your own custom models. LM Studio also lets you run a local inference server that mimics the OpenAI API, so you can use any model with your favourite tools and frameworks. LM Studio is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux, and you can download it from their website.

To facilitate this transition, an official feature known as in-place migration has been introduced, enabling the seamless migration of classic CS to CSES without incurring any downtime. However, certain limitations exist, with the VM size used by the CS role being a notable factor. As per documentation, the A-series, encompassing Small, Medium, and Large VM sizes, is no longer supported in CSES, necessitating their conversion to corresponding VM sizes as a preliminary step.

A global enterprise wants to migrate thousands of VMware vSphere virtual machines (VMs) to Microsoft Azure as part of their application modernization strategy. The first step is to exit their on-premises data centers and rapidly relocate their legacy application VMs to the Azure VMware Solution as a staging area for the first phase of their modernization strategy. What should the Azure VMware Solution look like?

Our systems can sometimes be a black box. We toss a request into it and get something back, but what goes on inside? Cutting through the tech jargon, observability is a measure of how well we understand the system from the outside looking in.
 
You might wonder, isn’t that monitoring? Well, not quite. Monitoring tells you when something is wrong, like if your CPU is overloaded or if there’s a glitch slowing things down (that’s the “What”). Observability, on the other hand, is like being a detective. It helps you understand the story behind the problem (the “Why”).
 
Let’s say an app is responding slowly. We might have all these cool charts and graphs showing us the problem, but do they tell us why it’s happening? Not always.

When we left off last time we had a network and a private container app environment on top. That could have been done by a non-programmer, but in this part your development experience might come in handy. And that is part of my motivation here - at some point in the deployment cycle developer eyes are needed to cross the finish line.

To start, with the Lifecycle management, you will be mainly transitioning blobs from one tier to another or delete the blobs based on the specified rule configuration. So, either Set Blob Tier (REST API) - Azure Storage | Microsoft Learn or Delete Blob (REST API) - Azure Storage | Microsoft Learn will be called underneath respectively. 
 
Now, the policy executes as part of backend scheduling and so the exact timings as to when the policy be executing on a particular day isn’t available directly. However, the policy will run once a day, and we can check for these metrics specifically. We will do this via a 2-step method.

In this episode, we host Muna Numan and Syntiche Musawu, co-founders of Tawi, an app that uses speech recognition technology to suppress background noise, enhance speech quality and transcribe speech all in real-time for children living with Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). With just earphones and a mobile phone, children with APD overcome a huge communication barrier, comfortably interacting with their peers and navigating the world with more confidence to achieve their full potential.
 
Team TAWI also emerged as the Microsoft Imagine Cup 2023 World Champions, and in this episode, they talk about:

The ins and outs of their product (including the architecture under the hood)
AI technologies that power the product – Azure AI Service (Speech service) and OpenAI’s Whisper (now available on Microsoft Azure)
Challenges, including conflicts during the team formation stage and how they resolved this to achieve their mission.
A one-stop shop for all founders, Microsoft Founders Hub, that provided the cloud infrastructure they needed to build their product, at no cost.

In this blog, I will share the most common steps to help you avoid any issues that could lead to your cluster failing in the middle of the deployment.OS Installation 
If you are using existing hardware with a previous version of HCI, the wizard will prompt you to choose between a new installation or an upgrade. Opt for a new installation, but ensure to clean all the disks. This involves deleting all …]]></summary>

It's been a whole year of diving into the wonders of different open-source tools. It's been one year of working with product teams within Microsoft to showcase open-source tools, platforms and frameworks that merge innovation with collaboration. Surprising, right? Trust me, IT IS!
 
When we started off one year ago, the goal was to empower students, developers, founders, professionals and everyone on the planet with the opportunity to learn about open-source tools that can redefine the way they build solutions. For many, Open at Microsoft was just more than a show. It offered them the opportunity to connect with product teams and explore real-world scenarios of how these tools can be used to transform their organizations and tech journey.

Durable Functions enables you to write long-running, reliable, event-driven, and stateful logic on the Azure Functions platform using everyday imperative code. 
 
Distributed Tracing allows you to correlate operations together and track requests between services. This is especially useful for Durable Functions apps as they coordinate work across multiple services and VMs. 
 
 
Distributed Tracing V2 Improvements 
 
The first implementation of Distributed Tracing supported only the .NET in-process model and the Azure Storage backend. The V1 implementation is still in an experimental state. Distributed Tracing V2, on the other hand, is not an experimental feature and supports all Durable Functions lang…]]></summary>

También hemos escuchado a muchos desarrolladores que les gustaría aprender a crear sus propias aplicaciones de chat con RAG, pero no saben por dónde empezar. Por eso, estamos organizando un hackathon virtual para ayudarte a aprender a construir tu propia aplicación de chat con RAG en Python.

 

 

Del 29 de enero al 12 de febrero, realizaremos transmisiones en vivo en inglés y los días 31 de enero y 2 de febrero en español, donde te mostraremos cómo construir en nuestro repositorio de ejemplo de chat con RAG más popular, al mismo tiempo que explicamos los conceptos clave detrás de todas las aplicaciones de chat con RAG modernas. Los temas de las transmisiones en vivo incluirán búsqueda vectorial, control de acceso, GPT-4 con visión y más.
 
Mantente conectado a tus sesiones locales de Reactor. Esperamos involucrar a desarrolladores de todo el mundo, así que también tendremos transmisiones en vivo en español, portugués y chino. Habrá premios para las mejores aplicaciones e incluso un premio para el miembro más útil de la comunidad. ¡Mantente atento a tus sesiones locales de Reactor!
 
Para obtener más información, visita la página de Reactor para sintonizar tu evento local y visita la página AI Chat App Hack, donde podrás seguir los pasos para registrarte y unirte a la comunidad. ¡Te esperamos ya!

Some best practices can be leveraged to efficiently consume data from Microsoft Graph. This sample shows how to use delta tokens to retrieve a change set, in combination with subscriptions/webhooks, to get notified when a delta token should be used to get the latest changes without pulling the whole set of data each time. 
 
Understanding Graph API throttling
 
Throttling limits prevent excessive use that could potentially impact service availability. Most services apply limits to ensure optimal performance and reliability. Microsoft Graph API applies a multilayered throttling approach with service-specific limits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re happy to announce automatic image creation using Azure Image Builder is now generally available. This feature improves your speed and efficiency by allowing you the ability to start image builds for new base images automatically.
 
Automatic image creation is critical for keeping your images up-to-date and secure. It also minimizes the manual steps required for managing individual security and image update requirements.
 
You no longer have to manually update images that have been patched. Instead, you can create ‘triggers’ for the images you wish to update automatically and allow the Azure Image Builder service to perform the build for you.
 
Getting started 
You can get started using the auto image creation feature by following the instructions provided in the documentation: How to use Azure Image Builder triggers to set up an automatic image build.
 
Feedback 
If you have questions or feedback, please reach out to me at kofiforson@microsoft.com.]]></summary>

Recently, I've been building an app using .NET Aspire which I'm using PostgreSQL as the database and Azure Storage Blobs and Queues in.
.NET Aspire is awesome for this, as you can setup a developer inner loop super simply with the components that ship, and the nice thing about this is that locally PostgreSQL is run in a Docker container and Azure Storage uses the Azurite storage emulator (which also happens to run in a container).
The problem with this is that when you restart your app, you lose all the data in the database and storage emulator, since they are started fresh each time.
Turns out, it's a pretty easy fix - all that you need to do is mount a volume into the cont…]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-01-22T07:31:43.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure App Service supports HTTP 2.0. The major advance of HTTP/1.1 was the use of persistent connections to service multiple requests in a row. In HTTP/2, a persistent connection can be used to service multiple simultaneous requests. 
 
This blog will demonstrate how you can send HTTP 2.0 Request to app service for testing using C#:
 
Step 1:
Go to > App Service > Configuration > Enable HTTP 2.0

 
Step 2:
Create a .Net Core Console Application / Web Application as per requirement . In this example I have taken a .Net Core Console Application:
 
 
var client = new HttpClient() { BaseAddress = new Uri("https://<>.azurewebsites.net") };

            Console.WriteLine("Sending HTTP 2.0 Request.");

            // HTTP/2 request
            using (var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, "/") { Version = new Version(2, 0) })
            using (var response = await client.SendAsync(request))
                Console.WriteLine(response);


 
 
The HTTPClient class has DefaultRequestVersion property with which you can set the default version of the requests as below:
 
 
var SecondRequest = new HttpClient()
            {
                BaseAddress = new Uri("https://<>.azurewebsites.net"),
                DefaultRequestVersion = new Version(2, 0)
            };

            // HTTP/2 is default
            using (var response = await SecondRequest.GetAsync("/"))
                Console.WriteLine(response);
 
 
You should be able to see a successful HTTP Response once the code executes:

GenAI applications are those that use large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language texts or perform natural language understanding tasks. LLMs are powerful tools that can enable various scenarios such as content creation, summarization, translation, question answering, and conversational agents. However, LLMs also pose significant security challenges that need to be addressed by developers and administrators of GenAI applications. These challenges include:

Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of the data used to train and query the LLMs

In 2023 we saw a rapid rise of AI (in many different aspects) and yet again, as people and organisations are beginning to work out how to best use it, it is becoming a driving force behind more change and how products and services are delivered to customers.
 
In this article I will break down how AI is infiltrating the Development side of DevOps. We’ll look at the first 4 stages of the DevOps Lifecycle and break this down into different ways teams can incorporate AI.

Why step outside when I can whip up my own delights? You might be wondering what any of this has to do with Azure or Open AI. Well, as with any journey, I need a roadmap on how to get started. So, I wanted to learn how to make, not just any cake, but this delicious red velvet cake I had a few months ago.
 

 

Using GPT-4 turbo with vision, I can upload an image of the cake and request for a recipe. GPT-4 with vision model allows images as prompts and the possibilities are endless, not only for your personal requests but also for your business.

Many service providers, including OpenAI, usually set limits on the number of calls that can be made. In the case of Azure OpenAI, there are token limits (TPM or tokens per minute) and limits on the number of requests per minute (RPM). When a server starts running out of resources or the service limits are exhausted, the provider may issue a 429 or TooManyRequests HTTP Status code, and also a Retry-After response header indicating how much time you should wait until you try the next request.

When it comes to website security, one important step is to add a custom domain and connect it with a TLS/SSL certificate. This not only enhances the trust and safety of your website but also ensures that your visitors' information is encrypted and protected. Azure App Service provides TLS bindings for the most common custom domains. This blog discusses the special domain and certificate binding situations in Azure App Service for IDN hostnames.

What is an IDN hostname?
An IDN hostname is a domain name that includes characters used in the local representation of languages not written with the basic Latin alphabet "a-z". These characters can be Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Cyrillic, Tamil, Hindi, and more.

Crafting Effective Prompts
One of the key aspects of working with large language models is the ability to craft effective prompts. These prompts need to be suitably constrained to elicit useful responses. For instance, an architect might want to ask for a solution architecture perspective response that meets specific functional and non-functional requirements.

Migrating a full-stack application can be an intricate job, even if you are using the same technologies on different clouds. Some things need to be done in order to have a fully functional application. If both platforms support the programming language and version, then that's one thing to put aside and start working on figuring out how to connect the database. Databases differ in the language they speak. You can use a universal dialect like SQLAlchemy that facilitates communication with multiple databases like MySQL. The last problem is to provide the application with the credentials it needs in a way it understands to establish a connection. Once you are done and the database is up and running.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The previous article explained how user could configure and limit the access to Cloud Service Extended Support (CSES) only from specific Virtual Network(s) by using internal Load Balancer feature. But for some scenarios, user does not really want to fully block the traffic from public Internet, but just wants to make the CSES safer. In this scenario, adding an Azure Application Gateway in front of CSES will be a good idea. It can provide following benefits:

From public Internet, the traffic is only able to reach CSES through Application Gateway
From Virtual Network, the traffic is not blocked by this design
User can add additional feature such as Web Application Firewall to make the traffic safer

 
Generally speaking, Azure Application Gateway is an OSI layer 7 service. It can be used fo…]]></summary>

This article will provide a demonstration on how to utilize either SAS token authentication or managed identity from API Management to make requests to Azure Storage. Furthermore, it will explore and compare the differences between these two options.
 
Comparision
The choice between Managed Identity and SAS Token depends on factors such as the level of control required, the duration of access, and the specific security requirements of your application. Both options offer different levels of access control and security features for accessing Azure Storage.
 
Azure Managed Identity vs. SAS (Shared Access Signature) Token

It offers dynamic site acceleration, SSL offloading, domain and certificate management, application firewall, and URL-based routing”. We can consider this as an Application Gateway at global scale with CDN profile thrown in to spice it up. AGIC or Application Gateway as Ingress Controller is already available and widely used. I received this question recently, asking whether Azure Front Door can be used in the same way.

In today’s azure world, it is always better to do automations rather than do a Manual work. It becomes a headache for all of us to navigate to Azure Portal 
 
Here is the simple way to disable Public Network access by using PowerShell script.
 
Solution:
 
 
Connect-AzAccount
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId "<Sub ID>"
$accessToken = $(Get-AzAccessToken).Token
$body = '{"location": "xxxxxx","properties": {"publicNetworkAccess": "Disabled","defaultAction": "Deny","virtualNetworkRules": [],"ipRules": []}}' | ConvertTo-Json
$obj = ConvertFrom-Json -InputObject $body
$uri = 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<Sub ID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.Relay/namespaces/<NS>/networkrulesets/default?api-version=2021-11-01'
Invoke-RestMethod -Method PUT -Uri $uri -Headers @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $accessToken" } -Body $obj -ContentType "application/json"

 
 
 
Please find below steps on how to run the PowerShell script to disable Public Network access for Azure Relay. 
 
Step 1: Login to Azure portal
 
Step 2: Open Azure PowerShell terminal and connect to your Azure account using any of options mentioned in Authentication Methods
 
Step 3: Just add the Resource Group name and Subscription Id and Relay namespace.
 
Step 4: Run the above commands to enable Public Network access for Azure Relay

Presently, we have two ways where Copilot works in Microsoft Dataverse.

GitHub Classroom allows educators to create unit tests to automatically score students’ programming tasks. However, the pre-condition for running unit tests is that the project codes must be runnable or compile without error. Therefore, if students cannot keep the project fully runnable, they will only receive a zero mark. This is undesirable, especially in the programming practical test situation. Even if students submit partially correct code statements, they should earn some scores. As a result, educator will need to review all source codes one by one. This task is very exhausting, time-consuming, and hard to grade in a fair and consistent manner.

Many service providers, including OpenAI usually set limits on the number of calls that can be made. In the case of Azure OpenAI, there are token limits (TPM or tokens per minute) and limits on the number of requests per minute (RPM). When a server starts running out of resources or the service limits are exhausted, the provider may issue a 429 or TooManyRequests HTTP Status code, and also a Retry-After response header indicating how much time you should wait until you try the next request.

Azure Container Apps is a great platform for running polyglot apps and containers of all kinds in Azure, as it abstracts away the complexity of managing underlying Kubernetes while providing unified networking, observability, and scaling for higher developer velocity. While it serves as a versatile container platform, it may not offer precise insights into your Java applications or the state of your Java execution environment (such as the JVM). To better cater to our Java-centric customers running containerized apps, we've recently initiated a new journey to enhance the Java developer experience on Azure Container Apps.

TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384_P384​
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256_P256

To obtain a list of the ciphers currently running on a Linux environment, you can utilize the 'openssl ciphers -v' command. Running this command will provide you with an output containing all the ciphers available on the client machine:

 
Once you have verified the presence of the correct ciphers on the client machine, you can proceed to check the TLS version being used to connect to a remote server in a Linux environment. Here are the steps to follow:


Open a terminal on your Linux system.


Use the following command to inspect the TLS version supported by the cache:

Logs are constantly recording what is going on in a machine. Logs can provide help in tracking security related events, can be used for auditing, troubleshooting and more. In Windows, logs that are saved contain information about applications and the operating system itself. Moreover, these logs are structured and human-readable. For viewing the logs, Windows uses its Windows Event Viewer.
 

 
There are five main categories under Windows logs:

System - Logs created by the operating system.
Application- Logged by an application hosted locally.
Setup - Logs created in the process of installing or changing the Windows installation.
Security - Logs related to logins, privileges, and other similar events.
Forwarded Events - Events forwarded by other computers.

Cloud-native apps represent a modern approach to app development, designed with cloud technologies in mind. Unlike apps designed to run on premises, cloud-native apps can fully leverage the many services Azure offers. Many cloud architects opt for Open-Source Software (OSS) like Kubernetes and Docker when designing cloud-native apps, but turn to proprietary offerings like Cosmos DB when the benefit is overwhelming.

So I formed the team with Yanxin (Jeff) Luo(Embedded Software Engineer), Yankun (Alex) Meng(Duke CS & ECE), and Vivian Yang(Duke Fuqua Quantitative Management) in Duke Generative AI Hackathon to make it happen. Our innovative approach and dedication culminated in a significant achievement: “TalkwithMe” was honored as…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
 
When you create a Kubernetes cluster using the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you can choose between three “outbound” types to suit your application’s specific needs. However, by default with each outbound type, you will end up with a single egress “device” and a single egress IP address for your whole cluster. 
 
Problem Statement
 
In some situations, generally in multi-tenancy clusters, you may need more than one egress IP address for your applications. You might have downstream customers that your applications need to connect to, and those customers want to whitelist your IP address. Or maybe you need to connect to a database in another virtual network or a third party resource like an API, and they want to whitelist the IP address you can connect from. Either way, you …]]></summary>

Containers are popular for cloud native application development and have increasingly become the common target for software supply chain attacks. Thus, delivering tools to help secure containerized software supply chains has been a growing call of AKS customers.
 
Digital signatures provide a way for software consumers to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the containers deployed. Image signing has become one of the most popular solutions to the aforementioned concern. The signed container images enable users to ensure deployments are built from a trusted entity and verify that those images haven't been tampered with since their creation.

Write once, run everywhere: your app can be deployed to Android, Windows, iOS, and macOS without any change in the code!

In July this year, the first preview of the .NET MAUI extension for Visual Studio Code was announced [1], which opened the door to a long-awaited request from developers for the first time: to be able to create .NET MAUI apps on Linux.

Microsoft is happy to announce the public preview of Kafka Compression for Apache Kafka on Azure Event Hubs.  Kafka Compression enables message producers to transmit compressed data which is decompressed by the consumer.  By compressing your payload, you are able to save a lot of bandwidth and reduce the memory overhead on the brokers supporting your traffic. 
Kafka producer application developers can enable message compression by setting the compression.type property.  
Compression.type = none | gzip 
 
These changes are exposed in the header which then allows the consumer to properly decompress the data.  
 
The feature is currently only supported for Apache Kafka traffic and not AMQP or web service.

        <updated>2023-11-15T18:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today we are excited to announce General Availability of our partitioned namespaces feature, which allows the use of partitioning for the premium messaging tier. This means that the overall throughput of a partitioned entity is no longer limited by the performance of a single message broker.
 
Moreover, along with the partitioned namespaces feature we are also announcing an updated SLA. If you create a Premium namespace with the new partitioned entities feature enabled, in a region where Availability Zones is available, we will provide an SLA of 99.99%.
 
Partitioned namespaces work in close conjunction with scaling through Messaging Units, as the configured MUs on a namespace are equally distributed across the different partitions. Currently it is possible to scale up to 4 partitions, and as each partition can scale from 1MU to 16MU, this means we can scale up to a total of 64MU.
 
There are some differences between partitioning in the standard and premium SKUs. First, the number of partitions is configured during namespace creation on the premium SKU, while partitioned namespaces in the standard SKU comes with a fixed number of partitions. Second, unlike the standard SKU, partitioned namespaces in the premium SKU do not allow non-partitioned entities in them.
 
To enable partitions, select to enable partitioning and set the number of partitions during creation of a new namespace. Please note that it is not possible to change the number of partitions after creation. More details can be found in the documentation, including a list of regions that are currently supported.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you are a student developer or an entrepreneur who wants to build applications using Azure, you might be wondering how to choose the best Azure region for your needs. Azure regions are geographically distributed locations where Azure services are available. Choosing the right region can affect the performance, cost, and availability of your applications.
 
One way to compare Azure regions is to use Azure Speed Test and Azure Latency Test. These are web-based tools that allow you to measure the network speed and latency between your browser and various Azure regions. You can use these tools to find out which regions have the fastest and most reliable connections for your target audience.Azure Speed Test

 
Azure Speed Test measures the upload and download speed between your browser and Azure Blob Storage in each region. Azure Blob Storage is a service that provides scalable and secure cloud storage for your data. You can use Azure Speed Test to see how fast you can upload and download files to and from Azure Blob Storage in different regions.
Azure Latency Test

 
Azure Latency Test measures the round-trip time (RTT) between your browser and Azure App Service in each region. Azure App Service is a service that allows you to easily build, deploy, and manage web and mobile applications on Azure. You can use Azure Latency Test to see how responsive your applications will be in different regions.
By using these tools, you can get a better idea of how Azure regions compare in terms of speed and latency. You can also use these tools to test your applications in different regions and see how they perform. This can help you optimize your applications for your target audience and choose the best Azure region for your needs.]]></summary>

Some models use a dedicated Azure OpenAI Service resource per tenant, while others rely on a multitenant application sharing one or more Azure OpenAI Service resources across multiple tenants. Sharing an Azure OpenAI Service instance across multiple tenants can potentially lead to a Noisy Neighbor problem, resulting in higher latency for specific tenants. To mitigate this, ensuring that your application code is multitenancy-aware and incorporates appropriate measures is crucial. For instance, if you aim to charge customers based on their usage of a shared Azure OpenAI instance, your application should include logic to monitor and track the total number of tokens each tenant consumes.

When building a new project, we don't need a big database that scales and has lots of data, but we do still need some kind of data source. Of course, it is possible to fake it and have some hardcoded value returned by an API but that takes time to create and it's not a database. In this post, I want to share a solution to have a portable, self-healing, disposable, disconnected database that doesn't require any installation.
 
The solution? Put the database in a container! It doesn't matter what database you are planning to use or on which OS you are developing. Most databases will have an official image available on Docker Hub and Docker runs on all platforms. If you feel uncomfortable with containers, have no fear, this post is …]]></summary>
