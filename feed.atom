Federated credentials / workload identity federation allows your CI/CD pipelines in GitHub and GitLab to access your Azure subscription without any secrets stored in the pipeline config.
GitHub's azure/login@1 task handles this transparently, but I also explain how it works under the hood. GitLab supplies the necessary token directly to your pipeline run.
Both GitHub and GitLab are easy to setup and federate securely with your Azure subscription.
BitBucket can't be setup that way, because tokens issued by BitBucket don't have a predicable subject identifier.

In this blog, I explain how such a framework could be implemented through the use of prompt engineering for GPT to create a reflective, deeper format for learning. We are exploring some of these ideas in our AI courses at the University of Oxford, however all views expressed here are solely my own.

Why would you go through the hassle of a complete migration project if you end up with something just as inflexible, as monolithic, and as intrinsically inconvenient as the platform you’re moving away from?

Introduction 
 
Recently I am having an increasing number of conversations with customers on how best to manage container images in disconnected or highly restricted environments. Cluster security is becoming increasingly more important, a 2023 report by Red Hat showed that 90% of enterprises surveyed had experienced a security incident in their Kubernetes environments in the last 12 months.
 
There is certainly a trend from customers recently to harden environments making the most of Azure Services such as Azure Firewall to manage egress traffic or Network security groups to restrict traffic within an Azure Subscription. When doing this a problem arises regarding how to manage public container images that may b…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Grounding?
Grounding is the process of using large language models (LLMs) with information that is use-case specific, relevant, and not available as part of the LLM's trained knowledge. It is crucial for ensuring the quality, accuracy, and relevance of the generated output. While LLMs come with a vast amount of knowledge already, this knowledge is limited and not tailored to specific use-cases. To obtain accurate and relevant output, we must provide LLMs with the necessary information. In other words, we need to "ground" the models in the context of our specific use-case.
 
Motivation for Grounding
The primary motivation for grounding is that LLMs are not databases, even if they possess a wealth of knowledge. They are designed to be used as general reasoning and text engines. LLMs …]]></summary>

A common problem encountered when having Azure App Service behind Azure Application Gateway is
whether we can use the cookie-based affinity feature on Azure Application Gateway end instead to maintain session stickiness.
 

 
Answer is NO. Because as explained at Azure - Inside the Azure App Service Architecture | Microsoft Learn Azure App Service is distributed system 
and has its own frontend workers and backend workers, 
enabling cookie-based affinity on Application Gateway side only allows requests from the same end user to 
get routed to the same App Service frontend workers within a session

When a Function App is added as an API in APIM, there are some authorization details we need to consider while communicating from APIM to the backend function app.
It does not matter what Authorization level (function or anonymous) the function app has configured, APIM will always attach a function host key to the request. The host key is attached to the request as a header. However, we may experiment unauthorized errors even though the function host key is present in the request header.
So, this article is focused on analyzing one of those scenarios when communication between APIM and backend function app is truncated due to unauthorized errors.

You must be wondering how to find out total number of partition count for any Event Hub namespace??
 
On the Azure portal you can only see partition count per Event Hub Entity level but not Namespace level. It’s tiresome job to manually sum up partition counts of all the entities especially when you have hundreds of event hub entities under the namespace.
 
Here is a simple way to find out total number of Partitions under Event Hub namespace using PowerShell script.
 
Solution:
 
Use below PowerShell script to see the total number of Partitions under your namespace.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction and Purpose: 
 
Existing example reference architectures to implement network connectivity between Azure and Azure VMware Solutions (AVS) recommend the use of ExpressRoute Global Reach where available. However, there are also scenarios where either Global Reach is not available (such as Brazil South), or customers simply might have different requirements and need an alternate solution that substitutes Global Reach entirely.   
 
Generally speaking, one viable solution is to implement a public Site-to-Site VPN with Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) while enabling transit capabilities between an ExpressRoute Gateway and a VPN gateway. The goal here is to advertise AVS or other non-overlapping IP address spaces dynamically via BGP. This is commonly referred to as Overlay. For a Hub a…]]></summary>

Humility is an important ingredient and certainly collaboration across different groups is too, but especially in the architecture discipline. Because in the architecture discipline, there's no other discipline that he can think of in which you go from thinking that you know a lot, and you do know a lot, to the next day being “I've never heard of that and now let me learn about it.” If …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce Code-to-Cloud (preview), one of the fastest and easiest way to deploy and manage your web apps on Azure. Code-to-Cloud is a portal-based experience that takes an app-first approach to building, deploying, and running your apps. Code-to-Cloud makes it easier for developers to get started using Azure, without needing to be an expert on the hundreds of different cloud services. 
 
Detect the right Azure services from your repository
 

 
Code-to-Cloud lets you connect your GitHub repositories to Azure, and through analysis of the code inside your GitHub repository, suggests the correct Azure services you should use. Once you deploy, GitHub Actions is used to create a continuous deployment pipeline between your repositories and your newly provisioned cloud services. Once you've deployed your app via Code-to-Cloud, changes to your code will immediately be pushed to your connected Azure services. 
 
Bring your own repository or start from a template
 

 
Code-to-Cloud also provides sample templates, powered by Azure Developer CLI, that provide a helpful blueprint for getting started with Azure. You can use these templates to immediately create a GitHub repository, connect it to Azure, and provision a distinct set of services for the template scenario. Our templates include sample static websites, web apps, and APIs, in a variety of different languages.
 
Manage your app in a consolidated view
 

 
 
In addition to making it easier and faster to get started developing, Code-to-Cloud also provides a simplified, app-centric management experience. A "Space" is a loose collection of cloud services that, collectively, comprise the app you are building. You can manage your compute, database, caching, and other key services all within the same, easy-to-use management experience.
 
To get started immediately, you can check out Code-to-Cloud here. You can also read our documentation to get a better look at what Code-to-Cloud can do for you.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using Event Hubs capture feature, you can load real-time streaming data to data lakes, warehouses, and other storage services, so that they can be processed or analyzed by analytics services.
We're thrilled to announce the General Availability of Managed Identity support for capturing event streams in Azure Event Hubs.
 
Managed Identities when capturing event streams.
With managed identity, users can seamlessly capture data to a preferred destination by using Azure Active Directory based authentication and authorization. You can use system-assigned or user-assigned managed identities with Event Hubs capturing destinations.
Managed identities provide an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure AD authentication. Applications can use managed identities to obtain Azure AD tokens without having to manage any credentials.

 
In the context of Event Hubs capture feature, these manage identities are used to authenticate and authorize the event capturing agent with the capture destinations such as Azure Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen1 or Gen2.
When configuring event capturing for a given event hub/Kafka topic, users can enable capture and select system assigned or user assigned identity as the authentication mode.

 
Event Hubs Capture feature also supports capturing data to a capture destination in a different subscription with the use of managed identity.

        <updated>2023-05-23T15:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dev tunnels are a powerful tool to securely open your localhost to the internet and control who has access, so you can easily test and debug your web apps and webhooks from virtually anywhere. With dev tunnels, you can also share your local work in-progress with colleagues or clients to get feedback asynchronously without the hassle of deploying. Previously, the only way you could use dev tunnels was through Visual Studio 2022.
 
Today, we are thrilled to announce the public preview of the devtunnel CLI! To create, host, and connect to your first dev tunnel in seconds, please follow the documentation on Microsoft Learn.
 

 
Use cases
Here are some of the scenarios that dev tunnels enable with the devtunnel CLI or dev tunnels in Visual Studio 2022.

Test an app with external services. For instance, test and debug Power Platform connectors, Azure Communication Services APIs, or Twilio webhooks.
Test and debug a web app on other devices, like mobile phones and tablets.
Make an app temporarily available to others to review your work in progress on a web app or API.

Benefits

Secure by default – Each dev tunnel you create is only accessible to you using your Microsoft, Microsoft Azure Active Directory or GitHub account.
Persistent URLs - Retain the same tunnel URL for extended periods of time.
Support for multiple simultaneous ports - Host multiple ports on a single tunnel at the same time.
Global service availability - The dev tunnels service is available globally. Tunnels are automatically created in the closest available region to ensure optimal performance.
Tunnel inspection - Inspect tunnel traffic in a familiar interface, browser DevTools, to monitor and manage your web apps or webhooks.

To improve the devtunnel CLI, we encourage you to connect with us through GitHub issues to request a feature or submit a bug. We look forward to hearing your feedback!]]></summary>

In this article you will learn how to perform a manual failover to restore service as part of the task to identify the root cause of the problem even though the server is unresponsive.
 
A working example: One potential cause of an unresponsive Azure SQL database is a query that is fired by an API and consumes 100% of the CPU. In this scenario, it can be difficult to identify the problematic query without connection which allows you to query the data management views (DMVs) and pinpoint the problematic query. Once identified, you can disable the API until a fix is implemented.

This also plays a role in the security aspect of the service, so the service itself can protect customers from malicious behavior attacking their service Additionally, this call rate allows customers to estimate their usage and manage costs effectively by preventing unexpected spikes in traffic that…]]></summary>

Today we will be discussing the term concentration risk, which means concentrating your solution on one technology and how to avoid what one architect terms ‘silly miracles’. Our hosts will be David Blank-Edelman and our armchair architects Uli Homann and Eric Charran.
 
Eric defines concentration risk and gives an example.
 
Eric has friends in the financial services industry and the term concentration risk to them means over indexing or over investment in a specific area to the harm of the larger portfolio. The term concentration risk is gaining traction in the technology space also, specifically the architecture space because the same dangers of safeguarding your investment also exist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tout récemment j'ai eu le plaisir de répondre à une invitation de Matt Soucoup et l'équipe .NET en présentant une version en français de la série Let's Learn .NET Virtual Events – All Around the World. Mais de quoi s'agit-il exactement et comment cette vidéo pourrait-elle vous aider? 
 
Apprenons .NET - Azure ce partage en deux parties. 
 
La première est une introduction au concept de base du cloud. Pour ce faire nous avons utilisé les trois modules du chemin d'apprentissage: Principes de base de Microsoft Azure: description des concepts du cloud.

Décrire le cloud computing
Décrire les avantages de l’utilisation des services cloud
Décrire les types de services cloud

En plus du contentue de ces modules, nous avons aussi partagé notre expérience provenant de cas réels.  Ce parcours d’apprentissage vous aide à vous préparer pour l'Examen AZ-900: Principes de base Microsoft Azure.
 
La deuxième partie est une introduction l'utilisation de .NET avec Azure. Nous avons construit un site web que nous avons déployé sur Azure en suivant les étoupes du module.

Publier une application web sur Azure avec Visual Studio

En bonus, Laurent nous a montré comment utiliser GitHub Action pour déployer en mode DevOps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re excited to let you know that Azure Monitor – Container Insights now supports multiline logging! With this feature enabled, previously split container logs are stitched together and sent as single entries to the ContainerLogV2 table. Customers are able see container log lines up to 64 KB (up from the existing 16 KB limit). If the stitched log line is larger than 64 KB, it gets truncated due to Log Analytics limits. This feature enables the customers to directly consume the logs in meaningful ways without having to spend time stitching them with custom Kusto queries. Additionally, the feature also adds support for .NET and Go stack traces, which appear as single entries instead of being split into multiple entries in ContainerLogV2 table.
 
Why this is important:
Logs are an essential part of monitoring and troubleshooting applications running in containers. However, when logs are split across multiple lines, it can be challenging to consume them effectively. View the example of Multi-Line below:
 
Multi-Line Disabled

 
Multi-Line Enabled

 
 
To enable multi-line logging:
1. Make sure agent is updated to version 3.1.6 or later
2. Customers must enable ContainerLogV2 for multi-line logging to work. Go to the ConfigMap to enable ContainerLogV2 in Container Insights.

3. Set enable_multiline_logs flag to “true” in the config map.

4. Apply the ConfigMap:
kubectl apply -f container-azm-ms-agentconfig.yaml
 
Next steps for multi-line logging:
Read more about the ContainerLogV2 schema here.

But before we dive into the permissions and roles, it is important to understand the difference between 2 different versions of AAD, both of which can be used by software providers, depending on the scenario.
 
Difference between AAD and AAD B2C
AAD (AAD B2B) enables SaaS providers to extend their software to external users without the need to manage separate identity stores for their customers. By using AAD SaaS providers can define roles and scopes for their applications, without having access to AAD instances of the customers where the end users reside. In this…]]></summary>

You heard about MLOps, read about it, and might have even seen it in action, but starting your organization's MLOps seems harder than it should.
Before discussing modules, identities, pipelines, and other concepts, let's start with the basics. We'll start with a working example that you can use as a starting point to build your MLOps. This blog post will show you how to use GitHub Actions to automate the process of training and deploying a machine learning model using Azure Machine Learning service.
Skilling up - Learning MLOps
Azure Machine Learning SDK/CLI (V2) is the main platform used in this sample. In this article I will cover how to work with Azure CLI, which I find is a great starting point, as it allows for the most common (you may call it basic at times) …]]></summary>

Achieving high availability is crucial for businesses that rely on their SQL Server databases. With SQL Server on Azure virtual machines, there are two popular deployment architectures to consider: SQL Server Always-On Availability Groups (AG) and SQL Server Always-On Failover Clustering (FCI). However, choosing the right solution for your specific scenario requires careful consideration of various factors. In this article, we will provide a comprehensive guide to help you decide which approach to use, especially when deployed in the Azure environment.
Main Considerations:

Managed instance plans: If you plan to use Managed Instance (MI) in the future, AG might be a better option since you can add MI as an additional replica, making migration easier. While FCI can also work …]]></summary>

As services like docker, weaver etc are manually installed on the VM to set up Kubernetes cluster, there were different IP addresses used at different layers of the application (within the VM) and migrating them manually to “Azure public region” is a huge task which itself will take 6-8 months’ time (as per effort estimation).

Introduction
Why waste time grading assignments manually when AI can do it in seconds? 
It’s impossible to stop students from using AI tools to answer their assignments, and it’s nonsensical to ask them to do something that AI can complete in a second. The key is to ensure that students are working on their assignments on their own and not copying from others, then using AI to rephrase the language. In fact, it’s nonsensical for teachers to score student work manually when all student…]]></summary>

The fundamental model for Network Connectivity in Azure is Hub and Spoke. As compared to Azure Virtual WAN, the end user has more granular control of the routing and the ability to deploy shared resources on the Hub to be consumed by the Virtual Network (VNet) peers attached to it (Spokes). However, the existing official documentation to attain a Multi Hub and Spoke topology refers to models that include dynamic routing in the Hub using Azure Route Server and Network Virtual Appliances (NVA) which requires a level of complexity as a Network Administrator including the use of protocols like Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and Virtual extensible Local Area Network (VxLAN).

How To Enable Network Security Group for Private Endpoints 
By default, network policies are disabled for a subnet in a virtual network.
You need to assign the NSG name first in this subnet, then enable NSG in “Network Policy for Private Endpoint”, then the PE will be applied the NSG rule.

Suggestions for Using Custom DNS.


Set up less than 3 custom DNS servers. 


         Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) uses the CoreDNS project for cluster DNS management and resolution. Based on observation, it only takes the first three custom DNS server settings. If you specify more than three custom DNS servers, AKS will only use the first three.

Having the ability to identify clear root cause for incidents in production workloads is valuable, the best way to prevent future incidents is to understand what caused past ones. Of course you can have a good set of load tests but still, incidents in production environments can happen and it's crucial to have available data that can help to understand what happened so application can be improved and prevent replications.

David would like to start talking about the difference between synchronous processing and real time processing of data. 
 
Uli discusses the pros and cons of ‘real-enough-time’. 
 
In the early 1990s Uli was introduced to a term called “real-enough-time” by Norm Judah at an event and he wondered what does that mean? Norm then provided a couple of examples where architectures can go wrong. This is where architectures go and introduce a very complex technical solution to a very simple business solution and the idea here is if you…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure provides built-in diagnostics to assist with debugging an App Service web app. The primary aim of this blog is to guide one step-by-step to add instrumentation to your application, as well as how to access the information logged.
 
Step 1:
Go to >App Service Logs> Enable Application Logging (Blob) and select the desired Blob Storage and the Container and select the Level of logging.
 

 
For more information on different types of logs you can refer this document.
 
Step 2:
Below is the code we have deployed a .Net Core MVC web application in a Windows App Service.
 
 
 public IActionResult Index()
        {
            _logger.LogInformation("This is a test to send logs to : Blob ");

            return View();
        }

        public IActionResult Privacy()
        {
            return View();
        }
 
 
Below are different level of logs details which you can log:
 

 




Note: If you write logs to blobs, the retention policy no longer applies if you delete the app but keep the logs in the blobs. For more information, see Costs that might accrue after resource deletion.




 
Step 3:
Go to Storage Account> Container and select the folder with your app service name and download the ( .txt ) file to check the logs.
 

 
The Blob option also includes additional information in the log messages, such as the ID of the origin VM instance of the log message (InstanceId), thread ID (Tid), and a more granular timestamp (EventTickCount) in a ( .csv ) file.

This distributed microservices architecture allows multiple teams within large organizations to operate independently of each other and release new versions of their microservices at their own cadence. However, this requires an additional level of supervision to address observability, traffic management, and security use cases for service-to-service communication across these distributed workloads. This can be done by embedding logic directly within the application code of each microservice. Or it can be done in a transparent way using service mesh which deploys sidecars to application pods to achieve the same use cases…]]></summary>

When the website is hosted on Azure Cloud Service, when we visit the page, the w3wp process of IIS component will need to send out a request to the target remote server to read the needed data. 
 
But when the Cloud Service fails to read the data from the remote server and developer wants to troubleshoot this issue, it will be difficult as by default users are unable to track the outbound traffic from Cloud Service to these remote servers.

It is the next evolution of a public preview feature in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), that is built on the now deprecated pod identity project. Azure AD Workload Identity, is simpler to use and replaces pod identity. Azure AD Workload Identity on AKS is now generally available so customers can run production workloads using Workload Identity on both Windows and Linux and migrate applications using Pod Identity over to Workload Identity. 
 
Azure AD Workload Identity leverages Service Account Token Volume Projection giving pods the ability to use a Kubernetes identity (service account), to which a Kubernetes token is issued and OIDC federation which enables Kubernetes applications to access Azure cloud resources securely with Azure Active Directory based on annotated service accounts.
 
Since the open-source pod identity project is now deprecated, AKS will continue to support the AKS pod identity through 2023. To ease the transition, customers can run Pod Identity and Workload Identity in parallel on an existing AKS cluster.  Please note that during the Public Preview we enabled the sidecar to give customers time to update their SDKs, but this is not a supported configuration for General Availability. We recommend that customers update applications to a list of supported SDKs that will allow applications to talk to the AAD endpoint.]]></summary>

With workloads configured to consume only the necessary resources and dynamically scale to meet demand, businesses can optimize resource usage while reducing downtime. Additionally, Kubernetes allows organizations to deploy multiple applications from various teams or business units to a single cluster, resulting in significantly reduced infrastructure costs. However, this multitenancy approach poses a new challenge.
 
Consider this scenario: your cluster generates $100/day in infrastructure spend with a shared set of resources split across 10 developer teams. If 1 team consumes 80% of the cluster’s resources, it does not make sense to split infrastructure costs evenly across all teams at $10/day. Instead, your organ…]]></summary>

Background
When customers decide to expand their existing Horizon infrastructure to Cloud, VMware recommends a multi-site Horizon implementation using a multi-instance model with separate instances per site. Each instance works independently, with its own set of App Volumes Managers and its own database instance. Using separate instances per site is simple to implement and allows for easy scaling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure provides built-in diagnostics to assist with debugging an App Service app. You can send your logs from your App Service to Storage Accounts, Event Hubs, or Log Analytics.
 
This blog will guide you step-by-step to enable AppServiceHTTPLogs , AppServiceAppLogs and view them in Log Analytics.
 
Step 1:
Go to Azure Portal > App Service > Diagnostic Settings and enable the required settings you would like to send to the destination . In this blog I have taken an example of HTTP Logs and App Service Application Logs in a Windows App Service ( .Net Core ).
 

 
You can refer this doc for more details on supported log types.
 
Step 2:
In your application code you can use the usual logging options and send log messages to application logs. By default, ASP.NET Core uses the Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.AzureAppServices logging provider. For more information, see ASP.NET Core logging in Azure.
 
Below is the code snippet of the logging I am doing in my .Net Core MVC webapp.
 

 
 
Step 3:
Go to Azure Portal > Log Analytics workspace > Logs and query the AppServiceAppLogs table and you can see the logs being sent. You can use different levels of logging such as Error, Information, Verbose and etc. in your application and this will show up in your logs in Log Analytics under the “Level” field. You can filter out logs based on the level:
 

 
Similarly, you can also query AppServiceHTTPLogs:
 

 
Sample Queries in Log Analytics:
 




AppServiceAppLogs
| where TimeGenerated >ago(10m)
 
AppServiceHTTPLogs
| where TimeGenerated >ago(10m)




 
 
More information:

AppServiceAppLogs is now available for ASP .NET apps on Windows - Azure App Service

You can implement the server thumbprint in the .NET application code to resolve “Remote certificate is invalid” when multi-tenant web app is configured as client in client-server model and making HTTS request to a server configured with a private CA.
 
When a web app acts as a client and makes an HTTPS call to an external server secured by a private CA, the web app uses its default installed trusted root CA’s public key to validate the server’s certificate. However, the remote server certificate is signed by a private CA, and since there is no such trusted CA in the web app’s trusted source list, it will not be validated by the web app. You cannot modify th…]]></summary>

Without any doubt, machine learning (ML) is one of the most transformative technological areas these days. Affordable cloud-based compute, complex and more efficient algorithms, plus accessible big data volumes helped to make incredible scientific breakthroughs in various fields and achieve (or even exceed) human parity with computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP).
 
Quality and variety of data is crucial to the machine learning’s generalisation and reliability of its outcomes. At the same time, there are certain situations where data may be rare or hard to find. E.g., NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Center for Near Earth Object (NEO) Studies has been continuously tracking and cataloguing NEOs in its discovery statistics database sin…]]></summary>

I know that many developers and testers love using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on Windows VMs via AVD, but that can be complex to install, and usually means users leverage personal (expensive!) VMs to support one-to-one installs.

The Dedicated plan guarantees single tenancy and specialized compute options including memory-optimized choices. In addition, the new Dedicated plan runs in the same Azure Container Apps environment as the serverless Consumption plan. This allows apps or microservice components that may have different resource requirements depending on component purpose or development stack to run in the same Azure Container Apps environment.  An…]]></summary>

Très souvent, les entreprises rencontrent des problèmes lorsqu'elles essaient d'automatiser des processus et de développer des applications. Les employés n'ont pas toujours des compétences en programmation nécessaires pour faire le travail eux-mêmes et comptent sur le département informatique pour le faire à leur place. Cependant, cela peut souvent entraîner des retards ou des rejets de projets.
 
Pour aider les entreprises à résoudre ce problème, Microsoft a créé la Power Platform. Cette plateforme permet aux employés de développer leurs propres applications, d'analyser des données et d'automatiser des processus sans avoir besoin de compétences en programmation. Cette approche est appelée "No Code"/"Low Code".

The script below will detect and report (rather than delete) all files in the directory and subdirectories, group them by size, filter out groups with only one file, and report on the files of the same size with their full path and creation time.
 
NOTE: Please make sure you further investigate the duplicate files this script finds before any other action is taken.
 
 
 
 
 
# Get all files in a directory and subdirectories
$files = Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File

# Group files by size
$groups = $files | Group-Object Length

# Filter groups with more than one item
$duplicates = $groups | Where-Object {$_.Count -gt 1}

# Output duplicate files
foreach ($duplicate in $duplicates) {
    Write-Host "Duplicate files of size $($duplicate.Name):"
    $duplicate.Group | Select-Object FullName, CreationTime | Sort-Object CreationTime | Format-Table -AutoSize
}

This behavior occurs because Node-Cache and other private cache solutions are designed to store data in the memory of a single process. The private cache works properly when running on a single instance, as all requests are handled by the same process and have access to the same cache.
 

However, in a multi-instance environment like a multi-instance App Service, using a private cache can lead to inconsistent behavior and data inconsistency.

In our last blog we talked about how do you get meaning from your data and we started to talk about implementation ideas on how to make data meaningful, and today we will discuss what is data mesh architecture as part of that concept.
 
Data Mesh Architecture has two main components: data silos and implementation.
 
From Eric’s perspective a data mesh architecture encompasses two components or two concepts. It encompasses silos of data which are usually deep in a specific domain that you want to actually democratize and expose to other engines or stores. And then…]]></summary>

As a result of advancements in technology, communication, and transportation that connect the world more than ever before, code-mixed text has become prevalent in modern news, web articles, tweets, and messages. For instance, “Spread Your Wings, It's Late en My Melancholy Blues sluiten deze laatste BBC sessie af.” is a typical example of English-Dutch code-mixed sentences. Accurately reading such mixed-lingual text poses a significant challenge for text-to-speech (TTS) systems.

The objective of this article is to share a strategy that has been implemented for a client that asked how we can protect its production branches from having secrets in code.
 
After few discussions we have highlighted the following requirements:
 

The solution should be simple to implement: no more than one script to maintain and we didn’t want to have some sort of regex file to teach the script what is a secret.
A comprehensive monitoring dashboard should be available to reference all our repositories, pointing out the ones that have secrets and ideally what kind of secrets have been founded (ex: SQL connection strings, Certificates with private keys, etc..).
The solution should alert the developer when he is trying to add a secret in the git Organisation.

        <updated>2023-03-30T06:31:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The challenge:

To generate and load 1 billion rows of data into a relational database on Azure in a significantly shorter time frame than the previous 72 hours.

The problem:

The initial parallel threads were competing for IO and CPU resources, causing internal locking and slowing down the process even further.

Previous solution (scaling issue):

The application generated batches of 1000 rows.
To load 1B rows – the application should insert 1M batches!
Parallel threads generated locking and even deadlocks.

The solution:

Generate 30 million rows in each of 36 files with different first letter/digit in parallel with small modifications of the original application that generate the rows according to complex business logic.
Define 36 identical tables with a constraint on the custom GUID key according to the first letter.
Load the files in parallel to the relevant table according to the first letter and constraint and increase database resources if necessary.
Define one partitioned table according to the first letter with the same key.
Switch in the 36 tables (meta-data operation) into the partitioned table.

Result:

The solution enabled the generation and loading of 1 billion rows of data into a relational database within an hour, significantly improving the previous time frame of 72 hours.

In conclusion, the solution involves parallelizing the data generation process, partitioning the data by the first letter or digit of a custom GUID key, and optimizing the loading process by using parallel threads and increasing database resources if necessary. This approach can significantly reduce the time it takes to generate and load a large volume of data into a relational database and can be applied to all relational databases that support partitioning.]]></summary>

For example, you might want to enable a custom authentication process, create a sampler of your own, or design a testing element that is not yet released in the open source JMeter community. 
Custom plugins extend the core functionality of JMeter and may allow you to implement that custom scenario into your performance tests to fine tune your test scripts and reporting capabilities. Learn how to get more from your performance testing, using custom plugins and Azure Load Testing.

I made several changes in the codebase to ensure it is not too complex. Hence, please clone, fork it afresh. First thing first, once you clone the codebase, start with the main branch.

The previous version of Azure OpenAI Services Virtual Assistant was limited to being a client-side application, which required users to share two API keys, making it less secure and not suitable for production. Additionally, monitoring usage and preparing for course assessments on using OpenAI Chatgpt was challenging. Finally, cost-saving was also a concern.To address these issues, we have developed a serverless solution using Azure Static Web Apps. This new solution eliminates the need for users to share API keys, provides better monitoring of usage, and reduces costs. With Azure Static Website, users can access the virtual assistant through a secure and reliable serverless platform, making it an ideal choice for both students and professionals alike.

One of the most useful debug features of API Management is request tracing. The problem is: we need to reproduce the same client request with an extra header (Ocp-Apim-Trace) or tell the consumers to do so.
What if we could just generate the traces from the APIM clients without telling them to add such header or do that ourselves? Is there an easier way to have APIM log the request traces coming from the real consumers temporarily for a certain period without much effort?

Introduction
 
A unit test usually involves writing code to test a specific function or method, using input data and expected output data. The test code then executes the function or method with the input data, compares the resulting output to the expected output, and reports any discrepancies as errors or failures. This approach allows developers to test each unit of code in isolation, ensuring that their code is modular, well-designed, and functioning as intended.
For example, if you have a method that converts a full name to a first name and a last name and the input is John Doe, what you would want to validate is that the output of that method is John and Doe. If that breaks, then your assertion breaks, and you would need to fix your code. That’s the main idea behind any t…]]></summary>

In this post, I'll walk you through the steps involved, which include:

creating an "azure.yaml" file via `azd init`
adding a "main.parameters.json" file
properly tagging your resource group and resources with `azd-env-name`
for deployment targets, add the corresponding `azd-service-name` tag as defined in "azure.yaml"

To demonstrate the process, I collaborated with my colleague Farhat Saleem in the Customer Success Team to azd-ify a sample integration app template that guides users through the process of setting up API Management policy for sending data to Azure …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are launching a new way to pay for Azure Spring Apps -- the consumption pricing plan. This plan is now in public preview so you can start creating and deploying apps today. This new plan is super-efficient because you can start from zero and scale to zero vCPU.  You get more straightforward pricing across your containerized applications since it costs the same as Azure Container Apps, but with added value for Spring apps.
 
How does this work? With the new plan, you can deploy apps that don’t need to run all the time or apps that have bursts of traffic and only pay for the resources used. This is a “serverless plan”, which means your apps can scale out and in automatically depending on the number of HTTP requests or events they receive or simply run as always-on background jobs.

GPT-4 models are currently in a limited preview, and you’ll need to apply for access whereas the ChatGPT model is available to everyone who has already been approved for access to Azure OpenAI. 
 
These new models were specifically designed for multi-turn conversations and come with an updated API to facilitate conversational dialogue. When using these models on Azure OpenAI, there are two important changes for you to keep in mind: the introduction of the Chat Completions API (preview) and changes to how we'll be versioning models. This blog post will walk through these changes and what you should keep in mind when getting started with the ChatGPT and GPT-4 mode…]]></summary>

But is certification the silver bullet in building a successful career in IT?

Our latest scenario-focused pages allow you to utilize your own audio/video input and envision how Speech services can be tailored specifically to meet your individual requirements, specifically for video captioning and call transcription & analytics solutions.
 
Apply Azure Speech AI and GPT to your Own Data
 
Until now, you could use Speech Studio's scenario pages to preview our powerful Speech AI and conversation analytics features using pre-selected samples. As of today, our newest feature inside Speech Studio enables you to preview how our Speech and Language AI can be applied to your own data.
 
The video captioning experience helps you envision how the Cognitive Service for Speech can be used to caption videos in real-time, or how our batch API could be used to subtitle videos and enhance the experience using features such as phrase list, profanity masking, and stable partials.
 
In the call transcription and analytics experience, you can get a transcript of your own agent-customer conversation, along with speaker separation for two channel (stereo) audio, speaker diarization for single channel (mono) audio, sentiment analysis, PII redaction, and conversation summary powered by OpenAI's GPT models.
 
Both pages also provide you with sample code, allowing you to kickstart your development and deploy your own solution in a matter of minutes.

Although AAD-backed authentication has been an option for Service Bus for some time already, until now, users of the JMS 2.0 API still had to resort to local authentication using Shared Access Signatures (SAS). This new release brings a welcome change as it allows users to leverage AAD-based authentication, using service principals, and system- and user assigned managed identities.

Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code on-demand without having to manage infrastructure. It supports various types of triggers, including HTTP triggers, which allow you to expose your function as a RESTful API.
However, while working with Azure Function HTTP triggers, you may encounter a 404 error, which indicates that the requested resource was not found.
In this blog, we will learn the possible causes of the Azure Function HTTP trigger 404 error, along with examples to help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue.
 
Causes of Azure Function HTTP Trigger 404 Error

Solution Consideration – The Middleware
Before building an application, you should think and break down what you want to do before building. This process is often called "Solution Architecting". While we will not be taking a lot of time doing this, I would like to introduce you to the basics of it.
 
In our session case, we will look at the following:

The Frontend built with Power Apps; you can learn more about How to build a canvas app 
The Middleware that allows us to run the background process of our Asset Manager solution. This can be configured by using Approval flows within Power Automate 
The Backend allows us to store all the data from our solution, and to achieve this, we will Set up tables in Microsoft Dataverse


 
The Process Flow
When configuring a process that your Power Automate flow must follow, there is usually some set of steps business stakeholders often ask the automation builder to implement. 

Learn more on how to Automate the Booking Process with Power Automate.

So let's jump in and learn about how to use SWA Data Connections with Blazor.
Oh, and for something different, let's try also use a SQL backend rather than Cosmos DB.
Setting up DAB
When we've looked at DAB so far, we've had to create two files, a config for DAB and a GraphQL schema containing the types. Well since we're using SQL this time we can drop the GraphQL schema file, as DAB will use the SQL schema to generate the types, something it couldn't do fro…]]></summary>

DAB is a joint effort from the Azure SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL and Cosmos DB teams to provide a simple and easy way to create REST and GraphQL endpoints from your existing database.

This new capability enables customers to create an Azure VMware Solution placement policy and specify the number of hosts using the Azure Hybrid Benefit. With this enabled, it will unlock unlimited virtualization through the SQL Server licenses with Software Assurance. 
 
With this release, customers can take advantage of Azure Hybrid Benefit on their Azure VMware Solution nodes by running their SQL Server workloads on AVS by applying existing paid SQL Server Enterprise licenses with active Software Assurance. As a result of this, the VMs on the nodes running SQL Server will be licensed using the unlimited virtualization benefit available with SQL Server licenses that have Software Assurance. To get started, customers can use the Azure portal to configure and enable VM-Host affinity placement policies through the AVS menu and create placement policies with APIs.  
 
For more information on Azure Hybrid Benefit, please visit Azure Hybrid Benefit—hybrid cloud | Microsoft Azure. In addition, visit Enable SQL Azure hybrid benefit for Azure VMware Solution to view how a customer can enable SQL AHB on Azure VMware Solution. 
 
@Varun_Hariharan, Product Manager at Microsoft explains the benefits and how to enable the SQL Hybrid Benefit for your Azure VMware Solution.

Tape storage is not used only for backup in case of system failure, but also for archiving data for long-term storage.
 
Tape backup is a term typically applied to old/outdated technologies, but tapes are still being used to back up the data.

Sometimes the low-rated reviews are based on delivery, packaging... whereas a few high-rated reviews might be on cost but not on quality. Generally, reviews/ratings are displayed without any context which results in customers needing additional time and effort to get the most value out of it. Hence, we built this prototype using Azure Open AI to present the consolidated information from all the reviews of a product.
 

 
We fed all the reviews of a specific product to GPT-3 text-davinci-003 model with a prompt to classify the text based on the three categories – Cost, Quality, and Delivery. Prompt is where user provide the English text command which the API endpoint of the model will use to generate the complet…]]></summary>

Azure Application Insights is a powerful tool for monitoring the performance and availability of your applications. By sending web requests to your application at regular intervals from Application Insight’s servers around the world, it can alert you if your application isn't responding or responds too slowly. Since it is a useful tool to check the server's availability, some users may integrate the availability test feature of Application Insight with the API management service.
 
As the Application Insights server is in the public network, we need to ensure that the API Management’s endpoints should be accessible from the public internet. Therefore, when integrating with API Management service (APIM) deployed in an internal virtual network (VNet), there is a cha…]]></summary>

Maybe you do not need to run this model in real time, but only a few times a week or even less frequently. The perfect solution for you could be to deploy your model on a batch endpoint. 
Unfortunately, Azure Automated ML does not support batch endpoints. There is a known limitation that the scoring script that Automated ML creates only works for Online Endpoints. To overcome this limitation, you need to create your own  scoring script that specifies how your model should run and how your input data should be processed.

The way Eric thinks about architectural erosion is when architects and engineers work together, they construct a system or solution. They have launched that solution into production. It's performing well for a period of time and then change happens. Whether it's a change in requirements, a change in infrastructure, or a change in customer habits, DevOps signals saying that people are using a certain feature versus they're not using a certain feature.

To ensure you also keep your data safe and available in the face of a datacenter outage, link your workspace to a dedicated cluster that uses Availability Zones (now enabled by default in regions that support AZ).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For many in education, Microsoft Teams is the collaboration platform that allows students and educators to chat, share files, and collaborate on projects. Like many apps, Microsoft Teams uses cache to store temporary data, such as chat history and files. While the cache is useful for improving performance, it can also become cluttered over time and slow down the app. Deleting the cache can help improve Microsoft Teams performance by reducing the amount of temporary data stored which can also free up storage space. 
 
The Microsoft Teams cache can be deleted manually by deleting all the files and folders in the %appdata%\Microsoft\Teams directory for each user profile. This however can be tedious and can be automated using PowerShell via one line of script.
 
 
 
 
Get-ChildItem -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Teams" -Recurse | Remove-Item -Force -Recurse
 
 
 
 
Note: It's important to close the Microsoft Teams app on all devices and clear the cache for all users to ensure that the cache is completely cleared.
 
Please leave any feedback or questions about how to improve the script shared above in the comments section below.

In this article, we will look at Microsoft Power Platform and specifically Canvas apps. We will at Power Platform in a specific way namely debugging. 

So what do we mean by debugging? When you code, you need to figure out that the code does what it should. For example, you are fetching data from somewhere and you want to transform it in such a way that you're able to get the data you need from it and can display it.  

As a developer, you have a few different approaches you use for "debugging" namely:

You can now preview files of any size, but only the first 10MB of the file. You can download the file and open it in your default text editor to view the entire file. A status bar will appear at the top of the preview tab that informs you of files greater than 10MB


Multi Blob Download When Filtering by Tags

When filtering by tags, you can now download multiple blobs at once by clicking the Download in either the context menu or toolbar of the blob



 
Other features in this update include:

SAS Expiration Warnings

In the following example, function app tonytesthttp has been linked to static web app.
 

 
When we try to access the function app outside static webapp, we will encounter Bad Request error. We understand that the static web app must do something to block the request. We can try to unlink the function app from static web app. However, you will find the function app still encounters the same error. How can we make our function app back to normal?
 

 
If you read the official document (Bring your own functions to Azure Static Web Apps | Microsoft Learn) carefully, you will find following statement.
 
If authentication and authorization policies aren't already set up on your existing Functions app, then the static web app has exclusive access to the API. To make your Functions app accessible to other applications, add another identity provider or change the security settings to allow unauthenticated access.
 
It seems that the link operation will add authentication limitation to only allow static webapp to access the function app. If you navigate to the authentication setting of the function app, you will find the static webapp was added as an identity provider. Even we unlink the function app to static webapp, the identity provider will not be removed automatically. We need to remove the identity provider manually. After that, the function app will work again.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to announce that we have made significant improvements in the performance of the WP Admin.  Try out the WordPress site deploying from here.  
   
 
 Although WordPress is an excellent content management system (CMS), it isn’t without its issues. Sometimes its admin panel can be laggy, preventing you from easily managing your website. We have always made sure that WordPress on Azure App Service meets the performance requirements of our customers. However, we got to learn from customer feedback that we could do better for the admin persona. So we have enhanced the offering with accelerated performance for admin pages.
 
 If you have created the website before 1 March 2023, please follow the steps described in blog post here: How to improve performance of WP Admin - WordPress on Azure App Service - Microsoft Community Hub to improve your WP Admin & overall site performance.
 
Support and Feedback
 
In case you need any support, you can open a support request at New support request - Microsoft Azure.
 
If you have any ideas about how we can make WordPress on Azure App Service better, please post your ideas at Post idea · Community (azure.com)

One key aspect of using Azure Functions is choosing the right hosting and networking options to support your application's needs.
 
Choose the right hosting option
 
There are several hosting options available for Azure Functions, each with its own set of benefits and trade-offs. These options include the Consumption, the Elastic Premium, and App Service plans. In this article, we will take a closer look at each of these options and discuss the factors to consider when choosing the right one for your needs.

Using Hyper-V, students can install multiple operating systems and applications on a single physical machine. In a previous blog post, we covered steps to enable Hyper-V in Windows 11 via the Graphic User Interface (GUI). However, as many pointed out, there is a quicker way to accomplish this.
 
PowerShell is a more efficient and effective method for creating a virtual machine (VM) on Hyper-V, but what exactly is it? PowerShell combines a command-line shell, a scripting language, and a configuration management framework into a single, cross-platform tool for automating routine tasks.

Authentication is the process of verifying client or server identity before accessing resources to protect information security. Azure App Service provides sets of authentication technologies to protect and secure your web application. However, it is a steep learning curve to know all of them, and we often get lost in the details of documentations. The purpose of this article is to give you an intuitive way to understand the authentication features in App Service and a high-level summary of different authentication models and their usage scenarios.

There is a symptom with low throughput in Service Bus triggered function due to Service Bus's message session enabled. This blog we're going to do a lab to demonstrate the cause and effect of this situation.
 
Common causes:
According to session features description (Azure Service Bus message sessions - Azure Service Bus | Microsoft Learn), since a session receiver is created by a client accepting a session. When the session is accepted and held by a client, the client holds an exclusive lock on all messages with that session's session ID in the queue or subscription. It will also hold exclusive locks on all messages with the session ID that will arrive later.

Hence, if all the messages are with same session id, there is only one receiver can consume these messages one by one…]]></summary>

Creating test data is an important task for developers and data analysts alike. However, manually creating test data can be time-consuming and error prone. In this video, Thomas and Stijn demonstrate how to generate test data using Azure OpenAI GPT-3 within Spark in Synapse Analytics.
 
OpenAI GPT-3 is a powerful natural language AI model that can understand text and generate new text based on that input. By leveraging the prompts available through OpenAI, it is possible to generate a dataset that can be used for testing purposes.
 
Thomas and Stijn showcase how to create a single dataset into a dataframe and multiple dataframes that have a relationship with each other. This enables developers and data analysts to build specific test data for their own environments.
 
By using Azure OpenAI GPT-3 within Spark in Synapse Analytics, developers and data analysts can generate test data quickly and accurately. This saves time and ensures that the test data is representative of the production data, allowing for more effective testing.
 

 
In conclusion, generating test data is a critical task for developers and data analysts. Using Azure OpenAI GPT-3 within Spark in Synapse Analytics enables users to quickly and accurately generate test data that is representative of production data. This is a powerful tool that can help developers and data analysts be more productive and effective in their work.

Other than just storage, you may need to ensure your data is safe and easily scalable. This is where database systems come in handy. The two most used are relational databases and NoSQL databases.

When working with SAS, in case a SAS gets compromised, to prevent any un-authorized access via that SAS, the only option to revoke SAS is to recycle the Access Keys being used to sign the SAS. This in turn will affect all the SAS that have been signed using those set of keys. Also, if you are using those keys anywhere in the application, you will have to update the configuration on all those places.
 
To prevent this, we can make use of a stored access policy. The advantage of using the storage access policy is that you can control expiry time and permissions. Furthermore, if SAS gets compromised, you can edit the permissions of the SAS, make it expired or even delete the access policy …]]></summary>

Function App supports to integrate Managed Identities to connect to resources that support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. There are two types of Managed Identities: System-assigned and User-assigned. However, customer would choose User-assigned Managed Identity when the use case is like the workloads that run on multiple resources and can share a single identity or the workloads where resources are recycled frequently, but permissions should stay consistent. In this blog, we're going to introduce how to assign a User-Assigned Managed Identity (MI) to Function App that use Azure AD for authorization to access Event Hub resource in Event Hub trigger.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On 30 September 2023, Azure Automation will retire Run As accounts, and completely move to Managed identities. All runbook executions using Run As accounts, including Classic Run As accounts would not be supported after this date. Moreover, starting 1 April 2023, creation of new Run As accounts in Azure Automation will not be possible. Renewing of certificates for existing RunAs accounts would be possible only till the end of support.
To ensure you are using a supported authentication method, you must migrate all your runbooks to Managed Identities.
 
Benefits of Managed identities

Secure authentication to any Azure service that supports Azure AD authentication.
Minimised management overhead with easy access to resources.
No need of Certificate renewals as in case of Run As accounts.
Simplified runbooks with no requirement to use multi-line code.

 
Take immediate action

Review your Automation accounts, Runbooks, GitHub code samples to identify Remove all references to Run As accounts and make necessary changes to reflect Managed Identities only.
If you have existing Azure Automation runbooks using Run As accounts, you must migrate them to Managed identities.
If your Run As account certificate is expiring, it’s a good time to start using Managed identities for authentication instead of renewing the certificate.
Do not create new Run As accounts, ensure to use Managed identities.

Azure VMware Solution (AVS) offers a fully managed software defined data center based on VMware vSphere technologies in the shape of an Azure PaaS service. The PaaS nature of Azure VMware Solution results in a service that is functionally equivalent to your well-known on-premises VMware deployment you may have been using for years with some specific “restrictions” as Microsoft provides a service level agreement and therefor Microsoft is responsible for ensuring a robust and resilient platform in deployment and operation. Azure VMware Solution is functionally equivalent to on-premises VMware but due to the PaaS nature of the service there are significant technical differences to properly consider.

But there are a few fundamental differences between “Project Bose” and all the other solutions I found. “Project Bose” has a flexible backend and hence any changes in organizational structure can easily be implemented on it without disruption.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Arc for Azure VMware Solution? Simply put, it exposes your Azure VMware Solution resources (VMs, networks, datastores, etc.) to the Azure portal.
 
Using Arc for Azure VMware Solution, those resources can be managed via the Azure portal, even though they are within your vSphere cluster running in an Azure datacenter. Even better, there is no cost to deploy Arc for Azure VMware Solution. More blogs to come on Arc for Azure VMware Solution, but if you want to get some more details check out this video from Jeremiah Megie.
 
First things first. Let’s get Arc for Azure VMware Solution installed into your private cloud.
You will need to collect the following information to input into the PowerShell script, which, if you use it, will make the deployment a bit more straightforward.
 

Subscription ID and Resource Group where the Azure VMware Solution private cloud is deployed.
 Name of the Azure VMware Solution private cloud.
 /28 network segment for the ARC appliance.


The/28 network segment will be an NSX-T segment in the private cloud. Under the covers, the deployment script creates NSX-T segment for use by the ARC appliances. The value must be entered into the script as the gateway to the segment, followed by /28. For example, if 192.168.99.1/28 is entered, there will be a /28 NSX-T segment created with the gateway 192.168.99.1.
 
The other information you can get from the Overview blade of your private cloud.
 

 
Requirements

Your private cloud must have Internet access.
Also, because of the appliance size, ideally you would want to run this script as close to the private cloud, or from a machine inside the AVS Private Cloud.

The script can be found here;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure and Red Hat have had a long-standing partnership to provide customers with best-in-class cloud solutions, such as jointly-supported Azure Red Hat OpenShift, JBoss EAP on Azure App Service, and deployment templates for JBoss EAP on Azure RHEL VM’s. Organizations which are moving existing, on-premises deployments to the cloud at scale need purpose-built tooling that can help automate the process of analyzing their portfolio of applications for cloud readiness. To bridge that gap, we are excited to announce that Microsoft Azure has begun contributing to Red Hat’s Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA), a tool that supports large-scale Java application modernization and migration projects across a broad range of transformations and use cases by automating source-code analysis and providing line-by-line recommendations to migrate your applications to new Java runtimes or the Azure cloud. These contributions to the Red Hat MTA provide service-specific migration recommendations for Azure App Service.
 

 
The collaboration adds rulesets to the open source upstream of the MTA, known as Windup. These new rules search for some common scenarios and provide guidance for accomplishing the task in Azure:

Configuring data sources
Java Key Store usage for certificates
Using Maven to deploy to App Service
Proper use of the file system in Azure
Using Azure Service Bus for JMS
Using Azure Active Directory as an identity provider
… and more!

 
Check out this Video Demo for more information.
 
You can download the web or CLI client of the Migration Toolkit for Applications from the Red Hat’s website or install it as a VS Code plugin.

Use Case

When using Azure Event Hub, it is important and useful to monitor the 'lag' of the consumer group. 'Lag' refers to the number of messages/events that have not yet been processed within a consumer group. The larger the lag, the more the consumer group is "falling behind". Monitoring this property can help identifying overloaded consuming applications: Increasing lag indicates that the consuming application is not able to keep up with the load of the event hub. The ability to monitor the 'lag' is not part of the built-in metrics provided by Azure Event Hub, for the Azure Event Hub built-in metrics please review this document.

It turns out that we have done some arguing, but it hasn't been all that. The good news for you is we've been talking about the subject we're about to discuss and we have an argument already brewing.

Abstract
We describe how to protect a multi-tier application with multiple components (like JFrog Artifactory) on Azure Kubernetes Service against disasters like the complete loss of a region with NetApp® Astra™ Control Service and Azure NetApp Files. We demonstrate how the use of pre- and post-snapshot execution hooks in Astra Control Service enables us to create application-consistent snapshots and backups across all application tiers and recover the application to a different regi…]]></summary>

Microsoft kept its Microsoft Azure costs flat while its workload footprint grew by 20 percent.
 
Here at Microsoft, we’re a customer of Microsoft Azure, and just like our external customers, we’re trying to keep our cloud costs down.
 
“When I talk to customers, they're always a little bit surprised to hear that we pay the same rates for Azure that they do,” says Heather Pfluger, the general manager of Infrastructure and Engineering Services in Microsoft Digital Employee Experience, Microsoft’s internal IT organization. “We operate with the same licensing, the same pricing (as they do).
