        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m pleased to announce the first milestone release of Spring for GraphQL 1.1.0 is now available from our Milestone repository. This version will be shipped with Spring Boot 3.0.0-M5 due for release later this week.

Spring Boot 3.0 is around the corner and the community is expecting a compatible Spring for GraphQL version to go with it. Currently, the best way to prepare for the Spring Boot 3.0 upgrade is to upgrade to Spring Boot 2.7 and Java 17, but Spring Boot 3.0 has new baseline requirements, namely Java 17, Jakarta APIs and Spring Framework 6.0.

Given that Spring for GraphQL 1.0.0 was released towards the end of May this year, we didn’t feel we would have enough time nor feedback to go with a major release of the project for Boot 3.0. This is why the goal of the 1.1 release is simply to adapt to the new baseline requirements and provide a smooth upgrade to Spring Boot 3.0 for existing projects.

This first milestone brings those foundational changes: the Java 17, Jakarta APIs, and a Spring Framework 6.0 baseline. We’re also taking the opportunity to upgrade to GraphQL Java 19.x – a painless upgrade on our side, thanks to the GraphQL Java team! We’ve also replaced our internally developed context propagation mechanism with the new Micrometer Context Propagation library, that’s intended for use broadly across Spring projects. It allows Spring applications to propagate context across various such mechanisms, e.g. ThreadLocal, Reactor Context, GraphQLContext, and others.

In the next milestones, we will consider how we can adapt our current arrangement with important themes in Spring Boot 3.0: GraalVM native image and Micrometer Observability support. Given the short timeline, we might schedule some changes for a future version – again, a smooth upgrade is our top priority here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can use client side decryption of properties on Azure Spring Apps by following the steps below:
Add the encrypted property in your .properties file in your git repository.It would look like:


message={cipher}f43e3df3862ab196a4b367624a7d9b581e1c543610da353fbdd2477d60fb282f


Update the Config Server on Azure Spring App to use the git repository which has our encrypted property. You could do it directly from Azure Portal or use Azure CLI:
az spring-cloud config-server git set -n myspringcloud --uri <git_repo_url>

In your Spring Boot application, add the decryption key in the bootstrap.yml file. (You would need to create it if it does not exist)


encrypt:
  key: somerandomkey



[This is the key you would have used in order to encrypt your property earlier]Now, add some code to get the value of the encrypted property.


package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class TestController {

    @Value("${message:default}") 
    String message;

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String hello() {
        return message;
    }

}



Create an App, or deploy to an existing one.
az spring-cloud app create -n <appName>

 
Deploy your app.
az spring-cloud app deploy -n appName --jar-path <location_of_jar>

 
Assign a public endpoint (or use the Test Endpoints)
az spring-cloud app update -n appName --assign-endpoint true

 
Access your application to view the value.
https://<myspringcloud>-<appName>.azuremicroservices.io/

 
(Optional) You can check the encrypted values on the Config Server by following the steps mentioned in thisdocumentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-cloud/how-to-access-data-plane-azure-ad-rbac]]></summary>

In this How To, I will show a simple mechanism for writing a payload to Azure Blob Storage from Azure API Management (APIM). Some examples where this approach is useful:

Claim-CheckClaim-Check pattern is used to split a large message into a claim check and a payload. The claim check is sent to a downstream system which has a reference to the location of the payload. The downstream system then retrieves the payload for handling. You might want to do this when working with technology that are not optimised suited for very large messages (Service Bus) either by a size limitation or associated cost, or when you do not need to process all messages. 
Message LoggingApplication Insights is awesome, and though you can send payloads as part of your telemetry, this can result in a surprisi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[5G is not just a wireless network upgrade, it enables new application architecture paradigms which allow you to achieve business use cases that were unthinkable a few years ago!
 
Key 5G characteristics such as very low latency, coverage of large and broad areas, high bandwidth, and very importantly as a differentiator versus Wi-Fi, QoS, reliability, security, slicing, and even network APIs to interact with the network from your apps make those new scenarios possible.
 
We’re excited to share this Infographic or “cheat sheet” we created explaining the key topics related to 5G, fundamental characteristics of 5G, new possible topologies (5G Private MEC and 5G Public MEC), and some details and elements of a simplified 5G architecture when using 5G with Azure Private MEC solution.

In a previous post, we introduced the isolated process model, which decouples your function code from the core Azure Functions host, in contrast to the traditional model where we run them together in the same process. Functions V4 supports .NET 6 in both models, and the isolated process model also supports .NET 7 (public preview) and Framework 4.8 (public preview). In this update, we’ll re-cap some of our recent updates, outline some changes to look forward to, and expand on our thinking about future versions.
 
We will provide another roadmap update in early 2023.

What's up at Eclipse Adoptium? -- by George Adams
Take the suckage out of Microservices with Container Apps -- by Rory Preddy
Secrets of Performance Tuning Java on Kubernetes -- by Bruno Borges
Deploying to Spring boot apps to Kubernetes with GitHub Actions and feature flags -- by Brian Benz and Stephanie Crater

 

 
This year's keynote by Mark Little, VP of Engineering at Red Hat, will be on "Transactional Microservices in Kube-native Manner" where he dives into the role it place in distributed computing, which is not necessarily the kind of transaction developers typically use. Quarkus and Eclipse MicroProfile are examples of what this looks like today.
 
Special guest speaker, Lasada Pippen is a ground up, self-established engineering and technologist who now inspires people to overcome odds and face difficulties to pursue your dreams. For J4K, he will talk about "Hidden Gems" that you are and how to make cloud companies recognize this. Lasada will help you identify how valuable you are even if you're not being immediately recognized, how to navigate through this, and overcome hurdles to harness your success.
 
This is a once-a-year event with over two dozen sessions, exciting keynotes, and lots of learnings. So, what do you have to lose? Register for free and join the Java on Kubernetes community on September 28, 2022. Reserve your seat now.]]></summary>

However, one important factor that can be overlooked is that the test system itself needs to be running smoothly - otherwise the accuracy of your test results will be compromised!
 
While running a load test in Azure Load Testing you might wonder if you’ve configured the correct number threads (users) in your Apache JMeter script. A thread runs through a transaction from start to finish, and then repeats until the test is over. You may notice that a test runs successfully with a lower number of threads, but the test may fail with errors once you increase the load.

They make it easy to introduce stateful components to your app without needing to manually persist data to external storage, so you can focus on your business logic.

While I’m positive I’m not the first person to ask this, I think it’s an appropriate way for us to kick off this article: “How many developers does it take to define cloud native?”
 
I hope you aren’t waiting for a punch line because I seriously want to know your thoughts. Drop your perspectives in the comments...but if you ask me, the limit does not exist!
 
A quick online search of the topic returns a laundry list of articles, e-books, twitter threads, etc. all trying to nail down the one true definition.

Our customers have always known that there is no better service than Azure App Service when it comes to organizing your enterprise .NET applications. Leveraging our deep expertise in Windows, Visual Studio, and ASP.NET, we designed App Service and Azure SQL Database as the home in the cloud for .NET applications and the databases that power them.

Normally, this error message means the TLS handshake has failed to establish, and today I want to share the common reason for that: the NGINX-based AKS package limits certain cipher suites in the connectivity.
 
Symptom
Connection from the 2012R2 on-prem Windows server to the AKS would fail, with the error message: 

 
Troubleshooting

Capture the network trace, and you will find Encrypted Alert during the TLS handshake:


2. Note that the handshake would fail immediately after the client hello. This means TLS handshake fails to establish, and most often it's due to the server and client does not have common cipher suites to exchange.

This post provides a brief review of the Azure Well-Architected Framework and its cousin the Well-Architected Review and presents the case for adoption within your delivery organization. I will address this from several perspectives, including improvement of your organization's technical excellence, customer satisfaction, team upskilling, and alignment with Microsoft.
 
Having proceeded down the path as we integrated WAF into my own company’s processes, I wanted to share the benefits that have resulted, both internally and externally (with customers). Together, WAF and WAR provide a huge (and free!) set of resources for your team.

For a little while I have been doing this series on getting rid of credentials in Azure (although in retrospect I see that it would probably be more correct to say "getting rid of classic credentials"). Along the way we've covered federated credentials, managed identity, EasyAuth and more. It has been neatly packaged into CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions as well for further streamlining. I'm happy with the results so far even though some of it took quite the effort to pull off.
 
The EasyAuth login process was pretty much as far as we got regarding the user facing side of things as most of the work was behind the scenes making the infra work without the use of passwords and client secrets. And t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Function App under at least a Premium plan could have unlimited execution time. However, it might caused a duplicated invocation issue with a ServiceBus trigger because the "PeekLock" duration is up to 5 minutes (including renew).
 
It is a tutorial to reproduce such the scenario.
 
STEP 1: In Azure portal, create a new Premium python Function App and a Service Bus + Queue
 
STEP 2: Download the sample code and apply some changes.
https://cchlab.blob.core.windows.net/cchlab/cchlabsbf.zip
In "host.json", please specify the Function App timeout and the ServiceBus PeekLock timeout as below.

In "ServiceBusQueueTrigger1/function.json", please setup some configuration:
SBQ_STRING=<your service bus queue name>

Then, deploy the project to Function App.
 
STEP 3: Making an experiment with a short execution time.
Visit: https://<YourAppName>.azurewebsites.net/api/httptrigger1?t=<DurationInSecond>
Please specify the "DurationInSecond" to 30 this time, and you may see the result like this:

We apply this operation to send a message to the ServiceBus queue and told the ServiceBus trigger to pause 30 seconds before execution.
Now, please go to the monitor page:

You can see it is just a normal short invocation.
 
STEP 4: Making an experiment with a long execution time.
Visit: https://<YourAppName>.azurewebsites.net/api/httptrigger1?t=<DurationInSecond>
Please specify the "DurationInSecond" to 330 this time, and you may see the result like this:

Now, please go to the monitor page:

As you can see, there are duplicate invocations with the same message id, which might caused some potential business issues if we ignore them.
 
Conclusion:
Since we cannot adjust "maxAutoRenewDuration" to more than 5 minutes, we could only reduce the execution time from this ServiceBus trigger.]]></summary>

First, a client makes a network request to the Gateway

  
The Gateway is defined with a number of routes, each with Predicates to match the request to the route. For example, you can match on the path segment of the URL or the HTTP method of the request.

  
Once matched, the Gateway executes pre-request logic on each of the filters applied to the route. For example, you might want to add query parameters to your request

  
A proxy filter routes the request to the proxied service

  
The service executes and returns a response

  
The gateway receives the response and executes post-request logic on each filter before return…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post, we get a behind-the-scenes look at the engineering work required to change a critical platform component with code paths that are exercised billions of times a day while minimizing service disruptions and maintaining SLA for our customers. We provide a brief introduction to help cover the basics, go over motivations for doing this work, explain some of the more interesting challenges, issues, and bugs encountered along the way, and close with the results and the new customers scenarios enabled.
 
The challenge was huge, but we’re excited about the benefits this brings to Azure App Services and our customers:

One of the obvious benefits of open, cloud-based technologies is the ability to integrate a wide range of global services with on-premises resources. If you’ve developed for financial services for any length of time, you know this openness adds another level of complexity to development. When money movement is involved, you’re going to encounter a higher level of risk and compliance considerations.
This blog highlights just such an issue encountered by the DevStudio engineering team here at Fiserv, and how we solved it. I hope this blog helps you understand not only how our team works but gives you useful context for implementing your own solutions that prioritize security and compliance without sacrificing speed or functionality.

It's surprisingly simple to build a baseline for managing activity inside your organization - from getting everything running, to setting policy on the types of violations that should raise system alerts, to assigning permissions for those who should have oversight and a level of incident detail they can see. While more advanced settings like intelligent detections define un-allowed and allowed domains and risk score boosters detect unusual activities or previous policy violations.

In part 2 of this multi-part blog series, I am going to cover, as per the title 'Infrastructure', but that's a pretty wide remit. Stay tuned for further posts where I cover more progressive infrastructure topics, but in this post, I will cover two core building blocks that constitute the largest amounts of most cloud bills, compute and storage. Compute in the form of servers have been around for the last 50 years (and probably will be for the next 50). Whilst today we have containers, serverless compute and many forms of persistence stores, today I will give you my thoughts on Storage (Object and Block) and VM (Virtual Machine) optimization.

Here's a scenario that I want to put forth, you've got an existing API, maybe it's REST, maybe it's a bespoke HTTP API, none the less you're building a new client in which you want to consume the endpoint as GraphQL. We could go down the path of creating an Apollo Server and using the RESTDataSource, or using HotChocolate's REST support, but for both of these…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://spring.io/blog/2022/08/10/spring-web-flow-3-0-m1-released"/>
        <updated>2022-08-10T15:26:28.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been almost 4 years since the last set of Spring Web Flow releases. Nevertheless, the project continues to serve a specific need particularly well, arguably better than alternatives, and remains in active use. While there hasn’t been a strong driver for new releases, the upcoming Spring Framework 6 brings a Java 17 baseline and makes the shift to Jakarta EE, which creates the need for such a release in order to enable applications to migrate to this new baseline.

Today I’m pleased to announce the availability of Spring Web Flow 3.0 M1 in the Spring milestone repository. This release focuses mainly on compatibility with Spring Framework 6 and Jakarta EE. The Travel booking-mvc sample on spring-projects/spring-webflow-samples has been updated and the commit history provides example changes. One significant change is the need to remove Tiles which has not migrated to Jakarta EE. In the sample, Thymeleaf Layouts is used instead.

Note that Spring Faces is not included in the release due to its deep integration with JSF and the additional time and effort required to migrate. Please, reach out if you have experience with Web Flow and JSF and are interested to help out with the migration of Spring Faces to Spring Framework 6 and Jakarta EE.

If you have a Web Flow application and you plan to migrate to Spring Framework 6, please give this milestone a try and provide feedback through the project issue tracker. Special thanks to Ian Young and Scott Cantor for their substantial contributions to this release!]]></summary>

Registering and authorizing your users are major steps in the customer journey lifecycle within an application.

Failure to do so can result in duplicate logins and registration errors that abruptly end user sessions. This undermines the quality of the test.

where you have routed all traffic to Azure Firewall (or an NVA) and noticed that the VM (or anything else) is directly connecting to the private endpoint, bypassing the firewall...This might come as a surprise to you but this is due to the fact that whenever you enable private link for a given resource, a direct (more specific) route is propagated to the underlying NICs.

Monthly, Microsoft issues several updates during what is commonly referred to as “Patch Tuesday.” During Patch Tuesday, Microsoft assigns Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) numbers to cloud-based vulnerabilities when there is a specific message that we want to send about necessary action to take, either by our customers to protect themselves or by the industry to protect the ecosystem.
 
When Microsoft issues a CVE, there is almost always action required to be taken by the customer. In instances where customer action is required, Microsoft understands each customer has their own process and timeframe for applying updates. However, we recommen…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background  
The Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a management platform that you can use to manage your IT and development infrastructure with configuration as code. The Azure Desired State Configuration (DSC) extension helps bootstrap a VM to the Azure Automation State Configuration (DSC) service. The DSC extension can be installed on Azure VMs as a Virtual Machine Extension.  The DSCForLinux extension installs the OMI and DSC agent on Azure virtual machines.  
  
Over the past year, our team has been developing Automatic Extension Upgrade which now supports the DSC extension. When Automatic Extension Upgrade for the DSC extension is enabled on a VM, the extension is upgraded automatically whenever Microsoft releases a new version for the extension. You can do this by simply setting the flag to true via API, CLI or PowerShell as documented here.  
   
Security Recommendations  
We strongly recommend enabling automatic updates for the DSC extension as soon as possible. This update ensures that customers get important security or performance updates to the extension as soon as possible without manual overhead.  
   
As always, we welcome feedback from customers and partners which supports our efforts to continuously harden our products and services. We want to thank the Wiz team for their collaboration and commitment to helping make Azure customers more secure.]]></summary>

We are thrilled to announce that applying configurations to virtual machines in Azure and Arc-enabled servers through Automanage machine configuration (formerly guest configuration) is now GA. This is an exciting milestone for both the Azure Governance community and the PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) community.
 
Machine configuration provides a native capability to audit or configure operating system settings as code, both for machines running in Azure and hybrid Azure Arc-enabled servers, directly per machine or at scale. Machine Configuration is integrated with Azure Automanage, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Azure Policy and will continue to expand.

I’m still on vacation on the beautiful island of Maui, Hawaii, but I wanted to say hello (“aloha!”) and share this week’s latest roundup of all that’s good and glorious in the wide and wonderful world of Springdom.

Funny thing, today - the 2nd of August, 2022 - is also my 12-year anniversary on the Spring team. It continues to be a helluva ride, and I so look forward to all that lies ahead. Thank you, Spring team, for everything. Also, sort of coincidentally, I just got a nice promotion. (Thanks, Spring team and VMware). I’m also just about to hit 60,000 followers on Twitter. It’s been a weird, wonderful week, and not just because of all that, but because we’ve got a ton of great stuff to dive into this week (be…]]></summary>

Understanding Static Web Apps config
On SWA we have application configuration and you might think this is the starting point for what you want to do. But this is not quite right, this is actually used to control the configuration for the Azure Functions backend that you use, not the frontend for your application.

Query success percentage measures the number of queries that return a non-Http5XX - for example, when a query completes successfully or fails with user-side errors. This number does not include queries initiated by Azure log search Alerts or Azure Sentinel. This signal will be available via Resource health in the near future.

It enables the development process to continue seamlessly without the overhead of bloating development machines with several versions of software frameworks, DBMS, or other kind of development dependencies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You’ve been assessing the performance of your application. You’re confident that it’s functioning well. So, what next?
You can take it one step further and determine when exactly your application will break by pushing its limits. This is called breakpoint testing. It helps you identify the maximum requests per second that your application can handle before the performance degrades. Even if you don’t expect as many users as requests per second, it’s important to discover your application’s breakpoint and verify that your application can recover without a lot of effort. It also helps in understanding which component of your application fails first and why.

My family and I love Hawaii. It’s brimming with beauty and serenity, and while the island of Maui, in the state of Hawaii, is very small, the islands are humbling. They make you feel so very small. It’s surreal to sit there on the beach as the sun creeps down beyond the horizon and to realize there’s nothing but pitch black darkness and water for as far as you can see, starting just a few meters away. It’s endless. It has no end. Like the bugs in code. Endless. And humbling.

Use containers for platform independence
 
An application that runs in a container behaves the same, wherever you run it. That's because the container provides a stable infrastructure environment that doesn't change. You just take it to wherever you want to run it. 

This also enables you to run self-contained applications that do not rely on a runtime, like the Java runtime, to be installed on its host. And this experience is enhanced with cloud-based management and features when you run your containers in a service like Azure Kubernetes Service.

In this post, we'll containerize a Java application, push it to Azure Container Registry, and run it in Azure Kubernetes Service.

Java Records Support Improvement

The support for Java records as items in a chunk-oriented step was initially introduced in v4.3, but that support was limited, due to the fact that v4 has Java 8 as a baseline. In Java 8, records were not even in preview yet. That initial support was based on reflection tricks to create Java records and populate them with data, without having access to the j…]]></summary>

Microsoft and CAST partner together to automate migration and modernization of custom applications with Azure Migrate and CAST used together, under the Azure Migrate & Modernize Program, complementing the current Azure tooling capabilities.
 
In the past decade, organizations have been engaged in migrating their applications to clouds. Some of the in-house custom applications have been moved through simple “Lift & Shift” motions (Rehost) to quickly reach cloud and leverage some of its benefits, mostly at infrastructure level, example, in performance or resilience.
 
While shifted to cloud, these applications may not make best use from all cloud services – example, cope…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! How are you? This week I’m writing you from sunny Seattle, Washington, where we’re having our next installment of the SpringOne Tour series. It’s been a ton of fun seeing all these fun and friendly faces again and getting to see people, many of whom I haven’t seen since before the pandemic! I’ve also had a lot of fun seeing some friends from some of the big cloud companies here, Microsoft and AWS. It’s always interesting to learn how people are using the latest and greatest from Spring to build amazing systems and software targeting these cloud platforms.

We’ve got a lot to cover this week so let’s dive right into it!


  
In last week’s podcast, I talked to Kubernetes contributor and fellow Tanzu Developer Advocate Leigh Capili

  
Distributed Tracing With OpenTelemetry, Spring Cloud Sleuth, Kafka, and Jaeger

  
Ingress vs. Load Balancer in Kubernetes

  
Instantiating Multiple Beans of the Same Class with Spring Annotations

  
Curious about when and why to use Java 14 Records vs. Lombok? Check out this article

  
I put together this little example , thanks to Reactor lead Simon Baslé, showing how to handle pagination with the expand operator in Project Reactor: Pagination in a Reactive Application. It looks at how to eleganrly expand the contents of a reactive stream as new data (in a data pagination scenario) becomes available.

  
Spring Shell 2.1.0-RC1 is now available

  
Pushing a Docker Image to a Self-Hosted Registry

  
Spring for Apache Kafka 2.9 Release Candidate Available

  
This Apache Maven Survival Guide is quite interesting, to me at least!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the main missing pieces for the Compose spec support in az containerapp compose was support for the build key.
 
With the 0.2.0 release, there is now support for the build key.  The container image build is handled by Azure Container Registry, so you can either provide ACR credentials or a new container registry will be created for you as part of the creation process.  Only context and dockerfile are currently supported.  
 
Example Compose File for a .NET Web Api project:
 
 
 
 
version: '3'
services:
  api:
    build:
      context: ./src
      dockerfile: ./TodoApi/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 8080:80
 
 
 
 
Example Repository Layout:
 

 
Example Command:
 
 
 
cd dotnet_api
az group create --name dotnet_api_example --location eastus
az containerapp compose create \
            --environment dotnetaca \
            --resource-group dotnet_api_example

Log Analytics is a powerful tool to query your logs and gain insights from the abundance of data stored in them.
Sometimes, getting started with a query might be a challenge - especially for new users who are not yet familiar with our data structure and are not yet KQL fluent.
To assist users with their first steps in log exploration, we've introduced several tools, including built-in Example Queries and Query Packs, both designed to allow users to start their exploration with pre-built, curated queries.
Today we are happy to introduce another powerful way to start your log exploration - Find In Table.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am pleased to announce that the release candidate Spring for Apache Kafka 2.9.0 is now available (2.9.0-RC1) in the Spring Milestone Repo.



This version is not provided by Spring Boot dependency management, but it can be used with Boot 2.7, as long as you override the Kafka dependencies as described in this appendix, especially if you are using the embedded Kafka broker.



Notable Changes




This version uses the 3.2.0 kafka-clients version



Non-blocking retry bootstrapping is now more robust



New Error Handler Mode





By default, after an error, the DefaultErrorHandler performs seeks on the remaining records from the last poll and re-fetches them from the broker on the next poll.
With high error rates and large max.poll.records, this can cause unnecessary strain on the network.
For this reason, the error handler has a new property seekAfterError, when set to false, instead of seeking the records, the remaining records are retained in memory and the consumer paused for the next poll (or multiple polls if the error handler is configured to use the ContainerPausingBackOffHandler).





Pausing Containers





By default, when you pause() a container, it actually pauses when all the records from the previous poll have been processed.
This version adds the pauseImmediate container property, which, when true, causes the container to pause after the current record is processed.



For information about all changes in this release, see What’s New.

What we will try to make smoother is the testability part.
 
Let me take a step back here and explain. The built-in policies are great as a user-friendly way for implementing simple authentication use cases. A couple of clicks in the Azure Portal to create a policy, test it in the Portal as well, and send off a couple of parameters to the dev team to inject in their code and that's it. In theory.

I only just realized it was Tuesday! And you know what that means? It’s time for our weekly dive into the wild and wonderful world of Springdom!

How do architects define and think about Chaos Engineering? 
Chaos engineering is that part of application development in which you try to excise uncertainty about specific failure conditions that might happen with the system or its components. Many architects just guess what's going to happen if there's a failure condition, and in many instances, they don't even like to think about it.

Azure Functions are great for running tasks on demand, like processing queue messages or resizing images. They can run serverless, which means that you can run them without having to configure and maintain infrastructure. And with Azure DevOps Pipelines, Microsofts' Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) solution, you can easily compile your Azure Functions and deploy to the Azure.

Overview
 
Azure Functions is a Serverless component from Microsoft that allows you to create event-based functions that can be dynamically scaled to meet the demand. We can work with all kinds of events such as when a file is uploaded to storage, a message appears in the queue or a HTTP request is received.
 
Using GitHub we can take an existing application, fork it to our account and then create our own version of the application, all from within VS Code.
 
What's covered in this lab
 
In this lab, you will:

Fork an existing Azure Functions project on GitHub
Learn how to create and merge branches in VS Code

How do you fix it?
 

Ensure you have the repo on your local disk or clone a fresh copy with HTTPS or SSH. I'll use SSH git clone git@github.com:mbcrump/crumpbot.git as a sample.

Easy file management
 
Azure Storage is a versatile and secure storage service. You can create storage containers with folder hierarchies and store Blobs in them. But it isn't very straightforward to move Blobs between containers or between storage accounts. Azure offers several options to help with this, including Azure Storage Explorer.
 
In this post, we'll use Azure Storage Explorer to move Blobs between containers in Azure Storage Accounts.
 
Prerequisites
 
If you want to follow along, you'll need the following:

An Azure subscription (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin)
Two existing Azure Storage accounts with Blobs in one of them. Learn how to work with Blobs here

A simple way to run containers in Azure
 
Containers offer a great way to develop and run applications in a consistent environment. You can develop your app in a container on your local development machine, and run that same container in production, thereby eliminating differences in infrastructure between environments. And now, you can easily run containers in Azure with Azure Container Apps. Azure Container Apps abstracts the overhead of infrastructure and orchestration, making it easy for you to deploy and run a container.
In this post, we'll deploy a sample container to Azure Container Apps.

Application performance testing
 
When you build an application, you want it to be fast. Users should perceive it as fast and performant, even when many users are using it. And your application should continue to work without errors when it is under load. It can be difficult to know how your application behaves when it is used by many concurrent users. Azure Load Testing can help by putting your application under load and analyzing how it performs.
In this post, we'll test the performance of an existing web application with Azure Load Testing.

It is very important to keep secrets and settings out of source code to make sure that they can be changed easily and can be secured. A good way to do that, is to store your secrets and settings in a central service. Azure provides a service like that, and it's called Azure App Configuration.
Azure App Configuration can store secrets and settings for you in a central place, so that your application doesn't have to store them in source code. On top of that, it has the ability to manage feature flags. These are settings that you use in your application to enable or disable features, like a new menu-item that is only visible when the feature flag 'beta' is enabled.

Frontend web applications often rely on dynamic content retrieved from APIs. Azure Static Web Apps supports seamless integration with Azure Functions to create serverless HTTP APIs. Azure Functions is one of several popular options for hosting APIs on Azure. Today, we’re excited to announce Azure Static Web Apps has added preview support for integrating APIs in the following Azure services:
 

Azure App Service – host APIs built with frameworks like Flask, Express, Apollo, and ASP.NET
Azure Container Apps – integrate with APIs and microservices running in serverless containers
Azure API Management – aggregate multiple APIs in a unified API gateway

Automated deployments create better software
When you need to manually build and deploy your app, each time that you make a change, you will make mistakes, which result in bugs and downtime for users. Automating your build and deployment processes makes them less error-prone and allows you to deploy as often as you want. GitHub Actions can help to automate your builds and deployments and integrates with Azure App Service.
 
In this post, we'll automatically build and deploy code to an Azure App Service using GitHub Actions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! How are you? It’s been a hot minute since we last chatted. I was in Germany this time last week. Now, I’m back in beautiful San Francisco. Today the weather will climb to a monumental 84 F! That’s very unusual, for any time of the year, here in San Francisco. Most places here in San Francisco don’t have air conditioning. Some have heating. I bought a brand new condo in 2014 and it didn’t have air conditioning. You just open the window. I am privileged enough that I have air conditioning today, of course. I mention all this to say that it’s hot here! I worry for the elderly! When it gets this hot, the YMCA and other organizations typically invite elderly people to come in and get some cool air and water. It’s dangerous. Some days it gets even hotter. Very rare, but it does happen. I hope you’re all doing well. Take care of yourselves and each other, my friends. 

And, speaking of being hot, let’s look at this week’s roundup of the latest-and-greatest that’s hot off the press!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you haven't already heard, we recently announced the public preview of Durable Functions for Java. With this release, Durable Functions now supports .NET, Node.js, Python, PowerShell, and finally Java running on Azure Functions. In this post, I'll give a brief tour of Durable Functions for Java to highlight some of the capabilities and differences compared to other languages.
 
If this is your first time learning about Azure Durable Functions, I definitely recommend reading through the Durable Functions overview content first.
 
Orchestrator Functions

Since the launch of guest configuration in 2018, the product has been a key piece of many Azure security and Azure governance scenarios. The service enables customers to audit and report on configuration settings inside machines, at cloud scale. This past year, we have been working to support customers more holistically, shipping the public preview of  “Apply and Monitor” and “Apply and Autocorrect” assignment types, and are working hard on the upcoming GA of these capabilities.
 
We have been listening to our customers as well as the community and are excited to announce a name that highlights the current and future capabilities of our service. Guest configuration will become machine configuration. In addition to the name change, we are moving under the Automanage brand umbrella to reinforce the message that the goal of machine configuration is to reduce op-ex and customer burden in managing their Windows and Linux machines both in Azure and on-premises. It is important to note that the current experience within policy will not change. Customers will still be able to apply machine configurations at scale through policy assignments as they have thus far. 
 
This rebranding will go live soon in the Azure portal as well as our documentation. More information to come soon about the GA of our enforcement capabilities.]]></summary>

When the built-in user flows don't cut it you have to create custom policies based on XML, but it has been a somewhat bumpy ride getting the custom policies you craft uploaded to Azure. In the beginning you could only do it through the Azure Portal which made for a manual and error-prone deployment process. After a couple of interim improvements along the way we have eventually gotten to where it's possible to have an Azure DevOps based pipeline setup  invoking REST APIs to get the policies into the right place. It's not perfect though so I thought I'd take a crack at improving further upon this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In May, dynamic concurrency(denoted as DC in this blog) in Azure Functions became generally available. By enabling dynamic concurrency, the platform can adjust the concurrency of functions dynamically in the condition that the worker instance is healthy(like CPU and thread utilization is healthy). You can refer to more information about dynamic concurrency in this link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-concurrency#dynamic-concurrency.
 
In this blog, I am writing to introduce how DC works in Azure function apps with some tests.
 
How to enable Dynamic Concurrency?
By default, dynamic concurrency is disabled. With dynamic concurrency enabled, concurrency starts at 1 for each function, and is adjusted up to an optimal value, which is determined by the host.

Shortly after, Christian Dupuis joined, led the project for many years and initiated the Spring Tool Suite on top of Spring IDE.

Therefore, you should follow an authentication and authorisation process to use the API unless it's the public API. Those authentication/authorisation process uses either 1) an auth key or 2) an access token through an OAuth process.
 
Using the auth key approach, you can store it in a safe place like the Azure Key Vault service and fetch the key. It's a relatively simple process. However, if you need to use the OAuth process, it gets complicated with the following authorisation process. Here's the conceptual OAuth process.

What is APIM Authorizations
Before we dive into creating the application, let's quickly look at what this feature is.
 
In a connected system, being able to communicate between different Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms is a common task, but often these platforms will use OAuth2 to verify the user identity. This requires undertaking an authentication flow, which is fine if you're directly using the system, but what if it's being handled by a background job, like an Azure Function running with a Timer Trigger?

The first thing to point out in this landscape is that there are two distinct scenarios: brownfield and greenfield. Anytime you’re building something new, such as a factory, building or car, and you want to include Internet connected devices or components, you are working within a greenfield scenario. Anytime you want to connect existing devices and assets that may have been around for years to decades, this typically is a brownfield scenario.  The assets or devices were not designed to be network or internet connected by default.

Getting started with Azure Load Testing has never been easier. You can now create a test without prior knowledge of testing tools by entering a URL on the Azure portal. You can set up, run, and test a URL in less than 5 minutes.
 
Run a quick test

Create an Azure Load Testing resource. You can use an existing resource if you have one.
Once it is created, navigate to the resource overview page.
In the Get started tab, click on Quick test.
Enter the URL you want to test.
Optionally, you can change any of the load parameters like number of virtual users, test duration, and ramp-up time.
Click on Run test.

Congrats! You have created and run a load test for your web application. You can modify the test parameters or extend the test by downloading and editing the JMeter script. Learn more about quick tests here. 
 
Once you are done exploring Azure Load Testing, you will want to delete your resource to avoid ongoing billing.
 
For more details on Azure Load Testing, check out the preview documentation. Learn more about pricing details on our Azure Load Testing pricing page.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the features that Azure API Management introduced at BUILD 2022 was Synthetic GraphQL – building a GraphQL service from a set of REST APIs.  GraphQL is still relatively new - at least compared to REST and SOAP - but it provides advantages over REST APIs when dealing with client applications.  Firstly, the client can fetch all the data it needs to render a page in one request, whereas when the data is modeled for REST, it generally takes multiple requests to get all the data.  Secondly, the client can request what data it is interested in for rendering the page and the server returns just that data.  RESTful APIs normally have a static set of fields that are returned.  A client application rarely uses all the fields, so data is transferred and then thrown away.

If you're concerned about security and data protection, compliance should also be your concern. Think about cases where data is maintained for 12 months and you've accumulated it for over 10 or 20 years; this makes an attack surface 10 or 20 times larger than it needs to be. And from a regulatory standpoint, in many respects, the risk of not hitting compliance requirements can be far more damaging than a data breach.

Durable Functions (DF) makes it easy to implement robust stateful services that make full use of the scaling and billing benefits of serverless, all while using your language of choice: C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and PowerShell.

Setting up a dev box is extremely arduous for both geographically distributed and co-located development teams. As a developer, you're configuring different environments, weekly, and monthly, for new projects or team members. And it's not unusual for you to have costly over spec'd physical machines under your desk or hosted virtual machines set up for specific projects.
 
As a developer, you may need to access and work with sensitive source code or elevated privileges on your local dev environments to install custom tools in SDKs. It can be a difficult task for IT to give developers the flexibility they need while keeping devices secure.

As I do every year, I paid most attention to the opening keynote from Satya Nadella which often provides the high-level roadmap of core themes and exciting announcements that we can then use to find and attend deep-dive sessions into our topics of interest.
 
This year, the keynote was more packed with announcements than usual. As I do every year, I sketch-noted the entire thing and as you can see there was a lot of information covered.  If you're a visual-spatial learner, having a 1-page cheatsheet might help so I thought I'd share it.

ElasticSearch is exceptionally good at finding a needle in the haystack (e.g. When did the string "Error message #123" occur in any copy of application X on March 17th). It does this by indexing the contents of the log message which can significantly increase your storage consumption.

Azure Static Web Apps is a service that's perfect for your full stack as well as static files projects. Yes, you heard that correctly. Regardless if you are dealing with:

A static resume site
SPA application
Static site generator like Gatsby etc

Azure Static Web Apps is there for you and enables you to deploy your files to Azure.

how does that work?

When you create an Azure resource, it connects your GitHub repo to Azure via workflow file in yaml. This ensures that all your future work can be pushed to Azure with nothing but Git and GitHub.

Sounds like it's worth trying? If, so have a look at these resources

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-static-web-apps/
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview

What is Azure Static Web Apps CLI?
It's a CLI you run from your console. With it, you can do a lot of things like the below:

Work on your JAMstack app locally
Built-in framework detection
Serverless support
Authentication & Authorization
Login to Azure
Deploy & Ship from the CLI
New documentation site

Check it out, how it can accelerate your workflow building SWA apps :)

We’ve created new versions for Azure CLI, as well as new plugins for Maven, IntelliJ and VS Code. Existing versions will continue to operate in deprecation mode.  
You’ll see this change is already reflected in the Azure portal, Azure CLI, API, Azure marketplace, and VMware Tanzu product descriptions.  The name has already been updated in Microsoft Docs, but you will continue to see the old name in some places for a while as we work to update assets such as screenshots, videos, and diagrams. 
Changes in the Azure billing meter description, Powershell, Github actions, Azure DevOps task and Nubesgen will take place in upcoming weeks.  
As introducing the name change in Terraform unavoidably interrupts existing behavior, we’re still in the process of evaluating whether we’ll change the name in Terraform.  
 
Action recommended 

Upgrade to the new version of Azure CLI with
az extension add -n spring
You can optionally remove the old extension using 
az extension remove -n spring-cloud

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Event Hubs enables you to stream millions of events per second from any source using Kafka, AMQP or HTTPS protocols. Using Event Hubs capture feature, you can load real-time streaming data to data lakes, warehouses, and other storage services, so that they can be processed or analyzed by analytics services. 
 
Today we are excited to announce the preview of Apache Parquet capturing support in Azure Event Hubs. 
 
Why Apache Parquet for big data analytics?
Apache Parquet is column-oriented storage format that is designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. It’s open source and is not tied to any processing framework, data model or programming language. Parquet is ideal for storing any kind of big data and is built to support efficient compression and encoding schemes.  
 
Capture streaming data in Parquet format using Event Hubs
Using Azure Event Hubs, no code editor for event processing, you can automatically capture streaming data in an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account in Parquet format. The no code editor allows you to easily develop an Azure Stream Analytics job without writing a single line of code.
 

Once data is captured, any analytics service of your choice can process or analyze Parquet data. 
 
Get Started Today
You can try out Apache Parquet capturing feature in Azure Event Hubs using the following links.

To try out Parquet capturing feature, follow Capture data from Event Hubs in Parquet format.
You can follow the tutorial on Capture Event Hubs data in Parquet format and analyze with Azure Synapse Analytics.

We announced several new capabilities at Microsoft Build 2022 to help you gain intelligent and streamlined visibility into your apps and container workloads.
 
Intelligently view and identify root causes in application map with Application Insights

We have introduced an Intelligent view toggle on the application map feature that uses patented AIOps and machine learning models to guide you to the root cause of the issue being investigated. The map now can recommend the exact node to node edges that need further investigation.The images below illustrate this benefit:
 


Easily enable Application Insights for client-side monitoring of Node.js apps

We have introduced JavaScript auto-injection to Application Insights Node.js SDK that now simplifies enablement for client side monitoring.

 
Streamline your query experience from Container Insights

Our new ContainerLogv2 schema offers a streamlined querying experience by reducing your data to a single table as well as the number of required join operations.

 
We also recently introduced a public preview of Azure Managed Grafana and new Grafana integrations, with the ability to pin Azure Monitor visualizations from Azure Portal to Grafana and new out-of-the-box monitoring dashboards.
 
Learn more about Azure Monitor and monitoring best practices for your cloud and edge environments with our dedicated guidance cookbooks. We welcome you to reach out to us with any questions or feedback on our Tech Community.]]></summary>

It takes too many requests to fulfill the data needs for a single page.
The REST API returns too much data for the page being rendered.
The client application needs to poll to get new information.

There have been various attempts to solve these issues, and the current favorite is GraphQL.  GraphQL is a protocol specification that explicitly solves these issues.  The client application can specify the data they need to render a page in a query document that is sent as a single request to the GraphQL service.  A clie…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Log Analytics is introducing a new way to view and manage Table metadata from the Azure Portal. With this new experience our customers can view and edit table properties directly from Azure Portal->Log Analytics workspaces. Up until now, this was only possible using the Tables REST API or CLI.
 
In this blog you will learn how to manage each table’s plan and retention and archiving policy using the Azure Portal's Tables experience - which was lately introduced in preview.
 
From the Log Analytics workspaces menu, select Tables (preview).
The Tables screen lists all the tables in the workspace with their properties:

Type: Azure table \ Custom table \ Search results \ Restored logs
Plan: Analytics \ Basic
Retention properties:

Interactive retention
Archive period
Total retention period




 
To edit a specific table setting, select the context menu of the table you want to configure and select Manage table.

 
From the table’s configuration screen you can:

Edit the table’s Plan.By default, all tables in your workspace are Analytics tables. You can configure particular tables to use Basic Logs. The list of tables that are applicable to Basic plan can be found here. You can read here about the differences between Analytics and Basic Logs plans.
Configure the retention and archive duration in Data retention settings section.By default, all tables in your workspace inherit the workspace retention and have no archive. From the Data retention settings section you can set the retention policies for individual tables: Interactive retention and Total retention, and the Archive retention value is calculated as (Total – Interactive).
Note: 
Selecting a longer retention period will incur additional charges. For more information see our pricing page.Selecting a shorter retention period may result in some data loss.]]></summary>

Last month, I wrote about how work items in Azure DevOps can be automatically created as you receive alerts from Azure (Microsoft Sentinel Alerts and Incidents & Microsoft Defender for Cloud Alerts, Recommendations and Compliance Assessments).
In this post, I'm sharing how you can

Create a webhook that will close/dismiss the Azure alert/incident as you resolve the work item (State = Resolved/Closed), and
Reactivate the Azure alert/incident when the work item reopens (State != Resolved/Closed)

Solution Idea
Here's the high level diagram for this solution, see here for the logic app code.

 
Note: The following alert types do not need to be dismissed

Alerts that are associated to incidents will be dismissed together with the incident

Because while Azure App Services, which we have covered in previous parts, are nice and dandy they simply don't serve all your microservice needs.
 
AKS is kind of a double feature when it comes to going credless:

The first is what we've been doing up until now. The provisioning and configuration of the cluster is handled by a GitHub Action which is trusted by Azure through using a federated credential.
The second is that Kubernetes is a system of its own and part of that is having a credential and identity model inside the cluster regardless of Azure. This can in turn be configured to have Azure trust the cluster and create a bridge between…]]></summary>

Azure Container Apps is a modern, fully-managed, serverless platform for running containers. While we don't have to manage infrastructure, it's still up to us to figure out how to build our container image and deploy it.
 
Today, we're introducing a preview feature in the Azure CLI that streamlines the process of deploying to Azure Container Apps in a single command. Whether your source code is on your local machine or in GitHub, "az containerapp up" is the only command you need to get your app running in Azure Container Apps.
