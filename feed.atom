        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scenario
Customers follow the Microsoft doc to create CMK encrypted objects (data source, index etc.), but get the 500 Internal Server Error:
{'error':{'code':'','message':'Could not use key vault key to wrap/unwrap the encryption key. {\\'Message\\':\\'An error has occurred.\\'}'}
Possible Causes

The key vault host is incorrect, e.g. incorrect key vault domain.

Action: check the keyVaultUri in the Json payload.


The key vault host is inaccessible to search. For example, the key vault has public network access disabled but does not have a shared private link (SPL) configured from search. 

Action: check the SPL configurations or create a SPL. 



Note that if the key vault Uri is correct or accessible, the error message due to a wrong key vault key name or version in the JSON payload is slightly different. The error message has the complete key vault key path.
{"error": {"code": "","message": "Could not use key vault key https://keyvaultname.vault.azure.net:443/keys/wrongkeyname to wrap/unwrap the encryption key. The key vault key cannot be found."}}]]></summary>

Route summarization for Azure VMware Solution (AVS) is essential in the following scenarios:


Route Tables with a 400 UDR Route Limitation: If you need to direct AVS workload segments through a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) like Azure Firewall or a third-party firewall, you must create a User-Defined Route (UDR) for each AVS segment individually.

.NET 8 option for the in-process model
Since our last post, we have released support for .NET 8 on the in-process model! Apps already using .NET 6 on the in-process model can move to .NET 8 by following the steps in the updating to target .NET 8 on the in-process model guidance.
 
Please keep in mind that support ends for the in-process model on November 10, 2026, and you’ll want to begin planning your migration to the isolated worker model in advance of that date.

Comprehensive documentation is crucial for end users in open-source software projects, but manual creation and maintenance are time-consuming and costly. Traditional documentation generators like Pydoc rely on predefined rules and in-line code information. However, emerging generative AI techniques, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), offer new possibilities for enhanced documentation generation. Developed in partnership with Microsoft and UCL, DocAider aims to create an AI-powered documentation tool that automatically generates and updates code documentation. The tool leverages Github Actions workflows to trigger documentation tasks upon pull requests (PRs) opening, providing valuable insights into continuous documentation maintenance.

Data transmission and access control are critical aspects of security that need to be considered. SSH tunneling is a technique that can help achieve secure communication between different components of an application or solution. SSH tunneling creates an encrypted channel over an existing SSH connection, allowing secure data transmission between a local machine (SSH client) and a remote server (SSH server).
In this article, we will show how to set up SSH tunneling between containers running in the cloud that need to communicate with downstream resources via an SSH server hosted in a cloud VM.

In addition to providing a stronger security posture, this strategy is also in compliance with major data regulations like GDPR, FERPA and PCI-DSS. In this article, we’ll explore how CSE can provide superior protection for your data, particularly if an authentication and authorization account is compromised.

This approach is particularly beneficial because it allows the model to understand and adapt to new tasks with minimal data, making it highly efficient and versatile. By leveraging few-shot prompts, users can achieve high-quality results without the need for extensive training datasets, thus saving time and computational resources. Additionally, this method enhances the model’s ability to generalize from limited examples, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blob soft delete is an essential feature that safeguards your data against accidental deletions or overwrites. By retaining deleted data for a specified period, it ensures data integrity and availability, even in the event of human error. However, restoring data in the soft delete state can be more labor-intensive, as the undelete API must be called for each individual deleted blob. Currently, there is no option to bulk undelete all blobs.
 
In this blog, we provide a sample C# code that will help you restore soft-deleted data efficiently. The code leverages multiple threads to expedite the restoration process, making it particularly effective if you have a large number of blobs to restore. Additionally, this program can be configured to undelete blobs within a specific container or direct…]]></summary>

For example, you may want to allow some users to send messages to a queue, but not receive them. Or you may want to restrict access to a specific queue, topic, or subscription, but not the entire namespace.
 
To address this challenge, we are excited to announce granular permissions for Service Bus Explorer. To use granular permissions, you need to use Microsoft Entra authentication, and assign one of the following roles, either on the namespace level or on the entity level.

Service Bus Data Owner; Allows to execute both send and receive operations.
Service Bus Data Sender; Allows to execute send operations.
Service Bus Data Receiver; Allows to execute peek, receive, and purge operations.

In case you use a role which doesn’t have send or receive permissions, or you do not have permissions on the specific entity, the unavailable operations will be disabled. Furthermore, a notification will be shown showing which permissions are missing.

Data analytics has several benefits for different segments such as:

This means that even if we can use identity-based host connections to replace the AzureWebjobsStorage, which uses a SAS token, we still cannot remove the file share connection strings (WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING) that also rely on a SAS token. Therefore, we are unable to disable the SAS token in the storage account.
 
For now, when creating function apps in the consumption/EP plan, we have the option to create an app without Azure File. In this scenario, we can bypass the SAS token requirement for Azure Files and solely utilize managed identity to access the storage account.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the support for Azure API Management (APIM) STv1 platform ends on August 31, 2024, it’s crucial for customers to migrate their instances to the STv2 platform. This blog will focus on the new migration options introduced to facilitate this process, as outlined in the attached document.
 
Why Migrate to STv2?
With the end of support for STv1, instances on this platform will no longer have a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Migrating to STv2 ensures continued support and access to the latest features and improvements in Azure APIM.
 
New Migration Options
Over the past year, several limitations in the migration process have been addressed to make it easier for instances injected into a virtual network. Here are the key improvements:

Disaster Recovery (DR) and ransomware protection are critical concerns for organizations today, as the frequency and cost of attacks continue to rise. Our customers demand comprehensive and cost-effective options to safeguard their critical workloads without compromising application performance.
 
AVS collaborates with leading technology companies, such as JetStream Software, to deliver advanced DR solutions that offer both near-zero Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) and near-zero Recovery Time Objective (RTO) options. The JetStream DR and Ransomware solution implements Continuous Data Protection (CDP) by immediately replicating all data generated by protected VMs. It employs heuristic algorithms to detect data tampering by utilizing cost-effective and high-performance storage options like Azure Blob Storage, Azure NetApp Files (ANF), and ESAN-based solutions. Utilizing the VMware-certified VAIO APIs means that the JetStream solution is fully VMware Ready certified. This approach is unique compared to other market offerings that provide DR protection by creating intermittent snapshots.
 
JetStream has also partnered with Microsoft to develop a unique feature that rehydrates VMs and their data from Azure Blob object storage, deploying them to AVS nodes provisioned on-demand, to a pilot light cluster in AVS. This ensures a rapid and cost-controlled recovery that minimizes downtime in the event of a disaster or ransomware attack.
 
To learn more about the power of this integration, watch our sessions at VMware Explore 2024 in Las Vegas:

Throughout this post, I'm going to discuss how Azure Functions apps can be containerised both with and without Dockerfile.
 

You can find a sample code from this GitHub repository.

 
By the way, you might have a question like,

This also overrides the retention period for Task data; that is, if the Job contains Tasks which are still retained on Compute Nodes, the Batch service deletes those Tasks' working directories and all their contents. When a Delete Job request is received, the Batch service sets the Job to the deleting state. All update operations on a Job that is in deleting state will fail with status code 409 (Conflict), with additional information indicating that the Job is being deleted.
 
We can use below PowerShell command to delete one single job using job id:
 
 
Remove-AzBatchJob -Id "Job-000001" -BatchContext $Context
 
 
But if you have a large number of jobs and wants to delete them simultaneously, then you can refer below PowerShell command for the same:
 
# Replace with your Azure Batch account name, resource group, and subscription ID
$accountName = "yourBatchAccountName"
$resourceGroupName = "yourResourceGroupName"

# Authenticate to Azure
Connect-AzAccount

# Get the Batch account context
$batchContext = Get-AzBatchAccount -Name $accountName -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName

# Get all batch jobs with creation time before May 2024
# Replace the creation time date accordingly

$jobsForDelete = Get-AzBatchJob -BatchContext $batchContext | Where-Object {$_.CreationTime -lt "2024-05-01"}

# List the jobs
Write-Host "Jobs to be deleted:"
foreach ($job in $jobsForDelete) {
    Write-Host $job.Id
    # Write-Host "Deleting jobs..."
    Remove-AzBatchJob -Id $job.Id -BatchContext $batchContext -Force
}

This added capability allows developers to leverage the lightweight and widely used MQTT protocol for messaging, making it easier to connect and communicate with devices that have constrained resources. 
 
What is MQTT? 
MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight, pub/sub messaging protocol designed specifically for low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks. It's an ideal choice for IoT (Internet of Things) devices and other scenarios where resources are limited. Development teams even build chat apps using MQTT protocol.

Many established software teams work across multiple locations, basing their work on GitHub repositories. Such teams consist of people across different languages and cultures. It is common practice for large repositories to undergo localization procedures, which involves translating documentation files in such a way that preserve the context of work. This article discusses an application developed by a group of Students studying at Imperial College London who have been working in collaboration with Microsoft for translating Markdown files in GitHub repositories using Large Language Models (LLMs) from OpenAI. The application uses a Django backend, React frontend, and communicates with GitHub through its API as a GitHub App. The article includes link…]]></summary>

For the workload profile container app, private link support is not yet available. This is because the “Private Link Service does not support a load balancer that has an IP-based backend pool, which is used in Consumption + Dedicated environments (Workload Profile)”. Although we have a roadmap to implement this feature (Private link support for Workload Profiles · Azure Container Apps Roadmap), there is currently no ETA.
 
In the meantime, I will guide you on how to integrate a workload profile container app with Azure Front Door using an Application Gateway. The architecture involves using the Application Gateway private link to connect to the Front Door, and placing the Application Gateway in the same VNET as the container app to achieve this integration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When building HTTP APIs, it can be tempting to synchronously run long-running tasks in a request handler. This approach can lead to slow responses, timeouts, and resource exhaustion. If a request times out or a connection is dropped, the client won't know if the operation completed or not. For CPU-bound tasks, this approach can also bog down the server, making it unresponsive to other requests.
 
In this post, we'll look at how to build an asynchronous HTTP API with Azure Container Apps. We'll create a simple API that implements the Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern: with the API hosted in a container app and the asynchronous processing done in a job. This approach provides a much more robust and scalable solution for long-running tasks.

Testing the RestrictOutboundNetworkAccess feature in Azure Speech Service is essential for scenarios like securely transcribing audio files from your storage account. When outbound access is unrestricted, the Speech Service easily fetches and transcribes audio. But with restrictions, only allowed domains are accessible, ensuring data privacy and compliance with organizational policies. This is crucial for protecting sensitive data and meeting strict security standards. By testing these settings, you validate both the functionality and security of the Speech Service in different network setups.

This is a useful technique for maintaining regular backups of your database and storing them in a secure and accessible location. You will get an actual backup of Azure SQL Database stored in a storage account in .bacpac format, which you can restore or migrate as needed. The automation process involves creating an automation account that triggers a PowerShell script through a runbook to run the backup command and save the output to a blob container.
 
Prerequisites

Azure Storage account: The storage account is needed to host the database backups. You are required to set up a container within this account to store the backups.

        <updated>2024-08-09T20:39:31.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The article discusses a problem where numerous messages end up in the dead letter queue (DLQ) when the JMS service bus consumer connects to the Azure Service Bus using Qpid jars. The reason for the messages being dead-lettered is that they have reached the maximum delivery count.
 
The fundamental issue stems from Apache Qpid's message handling. Qpid utilizes a local buffer to prefetch messages from the Azure Service Bus, storing them prior to delivery to the consumer. The complication occurs when Qpid prefetches an excessive number of messages that the consumer is unable to process within the lock duration. Consequently, the consumer is unable to acknowledge or finalize the processing of these messages before the lock expires, leading to an accumulation of messages in the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).
 
To address this problem, it is crucial to either turn off Qpid's local buffer or modify the prefetch count. Disabling prefetching is achievable by setting jms.prefetchPolicy.all=0 in the JMS client. This configuration allows the JMS client to directly consume messages from the Azure Service Bus, circumventing Qpid's local buffer. Consequently, the consumer can process messages at a suitable pace, guaranteeing smooth processing and issue-free completion.
 
Why is Prefetch not the default option in Microsoft .NET/Java/Python libs?]]></summary>

Steps:

Create an App registration in Microsoft Entra.


 
 
 

After creation, note down the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID, which will be used later.


 
 

Create a Linux web app in Azure Portal and use Node.js.


 
 

After creation, note down the App Name, which will be used later.


 
 
 

Download the sample code in your development environment:

 
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-docs-code-javascript.git
 
 
 

You can use VS Code to open the react-spa subfolder.

 
 
 

Edit src/authConfig.js and make the corresponding modifications:




clientId
Specify the Application (client) ID obtained in step 2


authority
Fill in the Directory (tenant) ID obtained in step 2 in the specified format. (https://login.microsoftonline.com/<TENANT_ID>)


redirectUri
Fill in the App Name obtained in step 4 in the specified format. (https://<APP_NAME>.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/aad/callback)




 
 
 

Run the following command to install the relevant packages:

 
npm install
 
 

Run the following command to compile the project. After execution, a build subfolder will be created.

 
npm run build
 
 

Create or modify build/.deployment with the following content:

 
[config]
SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT=false
 

 
 
 

Publish your project, specifying the build subfolder during the publishing process.




 
 

After publishing, go back to the App registration in Microsoft Entra, find Authentication, create a Platform, specify Single-Page Application, and fill in the value of authority from Step 7.


 
 
 

Go back to the project, navigate to Configuration, and specify the Startup Command as follows:

 
pm2 serve /home/site/wwwroot --no-daemon --spa
 

 
 
 

After restarting the web app, you can visit your webpage using a browser.

In our latest video, we explored a real-world application of .NET and AI working together.
 Building a LLM from zero
Bruno and Shaltiel hosted this session where the main focus was to showcase how ASP.NET, ONNX Runtime, and TorchSharp are leveraged to build a robust product that handles over 100,000 requests a day in each server instance.
 
The hosts also talked about the integration of different deep learning architectures like BERT models and RNNs, which are focused to minimize latency and maximize performance.
 
During the session Shaltiel showcased how to train a model from zero using Python libraries and how to later export the model to ONNX format and use it in C#. Bringing the best of both worlds.
 


Make sure to check out the full video for an in-depth look at how you can start leveraging these tools today and propel your projects into the future of AI-driven development.

I decided to give the Node SDK a go just to see how well it works and stumbled upon a great cookbook tutorial by OpenAI. I took most of the code from that sample as-is, wrote a static front-end chat client for it, and then wired it up as a sample space called “Activity Planner Agent” that you can easily deploy in App Spaces.  The only prerequisite is that you’ll need an OpenAI API key, which we’ll walk through below.

What is it
Azure Web Apps or Azure Function Apps frequently communicate with Application Insights to log various levels of data, which can later be reviewed and filtered in the Log Analytics Workspace.
 
Taking Python as an example, the official documentation mentions that the OpenCensus package will no longer be supported after 2024-09-30.

 
 
The article suggests OpenTelemetry as the latest alternative. In response to the growing cybersecurity awareness among many companies, many users have disabled the 'Local Authentication' feature in Application Insights to enhance security.

 
 
Therefore, this article will focus on how Web Apps/Function Apps can use Managed Identity to communicate with Application Insights and utilize the latest OpenTelem…]]></summary>

Azure Site Recovery (ASR) is a service that often comes to mind when adopting a business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) approach. In summary, ASR continuously replicates workloads running on physical and virtual machines (VMs) from a primary to a secondary site. If disaster strikes and causes an outage, ASR will fail over workloads to the secondary site and ensure applications remain accessible, and later fail back to the primary site once it becomes available again. A secondary ‘site’ may be another Azure region, or a different availability zone in the same Azure region.
 
What ‘failing over’ actually means is creating copies of the protected machines in the secondary site, which ideally should retain all the configurations applied to the original VMs in the primary si…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A memory dump is a snapshot of the contents of a computer's volatile memory (RAM) stored for analysis or debugging purposes.  ProcDump is a command-line tool designed to monitor applications for CPU/Memory spikes and generate crash dumps when spikes occur. Administrators or developers can then use these dumps to pinpoint the cause of the spikes. This guide will walk you through collecting a memory dump using Procdump.exe for applications hosted on App Service (Windows).
 

Access the Azure Portal and navigate to the desired App Service.
Click on "Advanced Tools" and then "Go ->" to access the SCM/Kudu site.


 

On the SCM site, go to Process Explorer to find the PID of the w3wp.exe process, which is the application worker process.


 

Use the Debug console to open the CMD option.


 

Navigate to the System Drive and access the sysinternals path:

C:\devtools\sysinternals>
Note: The drive letter may vary (e.g., D:\ or C:)



 

Locate the procdump.exe file in the sysinternals directory, which will be used for running commands.
To collect logs for the application worker process, use the PID obtained earlier.
Use the following command to collect a full memory dump.

Procdump.exe -accepteula -ma [PID] [Path]

Path: Specifies the directory where the collected memory dump file will be stored.


Example: procdump.exe -accepteula -ma 5100 C:\dumps\



 

Initiate the dump collection and reproduce the issue the application is facing.


 

After the memory dump collection is complete, access the specific path on the SCM site to download the collected memory dump.



 
You can consult the following article for further details on Procdump commands and various parameters to utilize depending on your specific needs and troubleshooting scenario.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump
 
It's advisable to gather multiple sets of memory dumps because analyzing several dumps can reveal patterns and facilitate the development of an action plan to resolve issues effectively.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background
This article describes how to copy all Azure Storage Tables data between two different storage accounts.
 
For this, we will use Azure Storage SDK for Python to copy all tables (and the respective data) from one Azure Storage Table to another Azure Storage Table. This approach will keep the data in the source tables, and will create new tables with the respective data in the destination Azure Storage Table.
 
This script was developed and tested using the following versions but it is expected to work with previous versions:

Python 3.11.7
azure-data-tables (version: 12.5.0)
azure-core (version: 1.30.1)

 
Approach
 
In this section, you can find a sample code to copy all tables data between two Storage Accounts using the Azure Storage SDK for Python.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This blog emphasizes the process of gathering profiler traces for application hosted on App Service that is experiencing slowness. It also provides guidance on how to review these collected traces to pinpoint the root cause and take steps towards resolving it.
 

Access the Azure Portal and navigate to the desired App Service.
Navigate to "Diagnose and Solve Problems" -> "Diagnostic Tools"


 

Choose "Collect .NET Profiler Trace" option.
Configure the trace options to gather data from the specific application instance, including thread details.


 

Reproduce the issue at step 2.


 

Access and examine the generated report.


 

In the demo application, a delay of approximately 20 seconds was observed. Refer to the browser network traces provided below.


 

Analyze the profiler traces to pinpoint the cause of the reported delay.


 

After examining the demo app's code, it was evident that a deliberate 20-second delay was introduced in the Privacy method within the Home Controller.


 

Note: Default profiler log collection time is 60 seconds and it is possible to increase the default profiling duration by setting an application setting IIS_PROFILING_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS with a maximum value of 900 (i.e. 15 minutes).]]></summary>

At the time I said I would avoid bringing in .NET Aspire as it was in preview and earlier explorations pointed to it being somewhat buggy in those preliminary stages.
 
About a month ago at Build .NET Aspire went GA so that raises the question anew - should I use Aspire? Let's revisit our sample app and take a closer look.

In this blog post we will learn how to do Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using local resources in .NET! We’ll show you how to combine the Phi-3 language model, Local Embeddings, and Semantic Kernel to create a RAG scenario.
What is RAG?
Before we dive into the demo, let’s quickly recap what RAG is. RAG is a hybrid approach that enhances the capabilities of a language model by incorporating external knowledge. In example: using a RAG approach we can retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base and use them to generate more informed and accurate responses. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a LLM needs up-to-date information or specific domain knowledge that isn't contained within its initial training data.
The Components

In our latest video, we explored the new OpenAI .NET library, share practical demos, and provide essential resources to add AI your .NET development projects.
OpenAI Library for .NET
Bruno, Jose, Roger and Scott hosted this session where the main focus was the new OpenAI library for .NET. We talked about the story behind the library, several user stories and more. 
 
We also discussed the content of the GitHub repository. The repo includes extensive documentation, code samples, and best practices for implementing AI in .NET using OpenAI APIs. One of the highlights was the migration guide, a critical resource for those transitioning from version 1 to version 2 of the OpenAI .NET library. The guide provides step-by-step instructions and tips to ensure a smooth and efficient migration process. If you're planning an upgrade, don't miss out on this migration guide.

 
Make sure to check out the full video for an in-depth look at how you can start leveraging these tools today and propel your projects into the future of AI-driven development.

Introduction
 
Hi, I am Khalid Abdelaty a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, studying Computer Science Student @ Tanta University in Egypt. I am fancisanted by the opportunity of AI and  the ability to analyze and interpret data.
 
Power BI has seen massive growth in the past couple of years in the IT industry. With the exponential growth of data, employees face challenges in data governance. To manage this unmeasurable data, we need reliable storage solutions. Microsoft Azure facilitates the integration of Power BI with services such as SQL, Stream Analytics, and many others. This combination enhances the ability to work with complex data efficiently.
 
In this article, we will discuss the following topics:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year at BUILD we announced the public preview of the Network Observability add-on. Today we’re excited to share a massive upgrade to the network observability capabilities available to AKS customers. 
 
What’s new?
We are excited to announce Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS), a suite of services built to significantly enhance the operational capabilities of your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. Advanced Network Observability is the inaugural feature of the ACNS suite bringing the power of Hubble’s control plane to both Cilium and Non-Cilium Linux data planes. With Advanced Network Observability, customers can now pinpoint network-related issues with more precision and detect root causes faster.  The offering provides pod level packet statistics, DNS statistics, L4 connections and enhanced debugging capabilities with network flow logs and DNS error tracking.
Data flow for Advanced Network Observability
 
How can Azure customers use the new offering?
ACNS is integrated deeply with existing Azure Monitor capabilities for monitoring AKS clusters. Using the new capabilities requires no extra configuration from customers. Customers can enable advanced network observability with a single command. The metrics are then ingested automatically by Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus. Additionally, customers can visualize the metrics in pre-built dashboards in Azure Managed Grafana. Customers have access to 6 pre-built dashboards in Azure Managed Grafana covering a breadth of signals from cluster traffic to DNS and pod level flows.

Audit trails – understanding who accessed what at a certain point in time or what events occurred when
Financial transaction data – querying financial transactions by invoice id
Web analytics – identifying which pages were accessed at what date, time and location

This type of data can have millions or billions of rows to sift through.

RAG uses information from additional sources to enhance the output of a large language model (LLM).  If you’ve used LLMs like ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot, you’ve probably gotten your fair share of hallucinations, responses that are wrong, often to the point of silliness. In fact, Microsoft Copilot comes with a warning: “Copilot uses AI. Check for mistakes.” RAG grounds the responses in authoritative external knowledge making them more accurate and useful.

In our latest video, we went into the fascinating world of Redis and its integration with AI, specifically focusing on how it can enhance .NET applications.
 
Redis and .NET
 
Bruno, Katherine, and Stanley shared their insights on leveraging Redis for building intelligent, high-performance applications. They showcased two compelling demo applications:
 

A .NET Contoso HR web application augmented with AI and Redis for chatbot-style capabilities.
An eShop web application enhanced with AI for intelligent recommendations and improved performance.

The discussion also touched upon key concepts such as large language models, vector similarity search, and retrieval augmented generative AI, providing a comprehensive overview of the technical landscape. The integration of Redis with Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise was particularly emphasized, showcasing its ability to support vector similarity search and offer low latency, which is crucial for real-time applications.
 
This session was a testament to the power of combining Redis with AI to create more dynamic, responsive, and intelligent applications.
 
Resources
For those eager to dive deeper, several resources were shared.
 

Blog: https://aka.ms/redis-ai/04-2024
Documentation:https://aka.ms/redis-ai/vss
Redis branch at https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo-csharp/tree/redis
Vss branch at https://github.com/CawaMS/eShop/tree/vss

These resources provide a great starting point for developers looking to integrate Redis and AI into their own projects.

AI is all about probability, and the probability of it being incorrect, or behaving unexpectedly for a new input is practically never zero. In the classic chatbot days, this often meant getting an answer about something you're not asking about, or the good old "I did not understand" default answer we all "love" to see when we're having an issue. But with Generative AI, mistakes are much more nuanced, and may take the appearance of plain misinformation and, even worse, harmful content!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever wanted to create your own website or web service, but felt overwhelmed about how to get started with web development? Or have you already built a web app with Python, but wondered how you can deploy it online? If so, you might be interested in watching this video by and Pamela Fox and Renee Noble, two Python Cloud Advocates at Microsoft with a passion for web development and education!
 
They’ll show you how to create a web app with Python Flask (or it’s async-sibling Quart) and show you how you can deploy you can take your web app live by deploying it on Azure. This is the first episode in this live stream series (which you can also catch on demand!) by Pamela and friends covering different web dev frameworks and practices! (And you can catch it in Spanish too!)



 
In this video, you will learn how the web works and why you (likely) need a web server to serve up your web app. You will also discover how a backend web framework, like Flask, helps you develop your web server quickly and easily and how it lets you use templates to build dynamic sites - whether it’s your first site or a complex full-scale service.
 
Want to improve your web server throughput? Find out how you can port your app to Quart, the asynchronous version of Flask. And of course, you’ll see how you can deploy your web apps to Azure App Service in minutes and learn what other deployment options you might be interested in seeking out depending on your project.
 
The video is perfect for beginners who have some familiarity with Python, but no prior experience with web development or deployment. It is also suitable for intermediate or advanced developers who want to refresh their skills or learn new tricks. Take a look at the video to learn some concepts and follow along with our coding and deployment demos! You can grab the demo repo here and check out the slides too.]]></summary>

Why we use it
An increasing number of security vulnerabilities are caused by sensitive information in the source code being leaked or accidentally uploaded to open repositories GitHub, leading to the exposure of a large amount of user privacy. This information includes, but is not limited to, database credentials, app keys, etc. Traditional MySQL databases use usernames and passwords for login operations, naturally leading to the inclusion of these credentials in project configuration files. Even with proper safeguards, there remain unpredictable risks, such as hacking.
 
This tutorial will introduce how to integrate Microsoft Entra with Azure Database for MySQL to avoid using fixed usernames and passwords. By utilizing system-ass…]]></summary>

The above linked documentation covers how you would setup the Azure resource with Entra ID as the authentication mode, so I won't go over that here (also, you can configure that when you initial create the database, or using a Bicep script), instead I want to look at how we use that in a .NET application, because when you're connecting using Entra ID you don't have a pas…]]></summary>

We have seen that before load testing these endpoints, most users generate an access token and store it in the Azure Key Vault. They then pass this token as a variable in the Header of the request as a bearer token to authenticate at the endpoint. But there might be a few problems with this approach: 
 

Sometime has elapsed between the act of storing the token in the key vault and the start of execution of the test. There can be a case where the token might expire during the test run and the request at the endpoints start throwing errors.

First, let’s provide an overview of how Cosmos DB is being used in this scenario. As per the architectural overview shown below, there are an ecosystem of Customer systems that emit data, these hit a pipeline and are then inserted into Cosmos DB via a Batch process.

 
The original design from 2019 had only a single container, Data, which contained all of the documents that were ingested into Cosmos DB. As the Data Container grew and reached a point where Query performance and RU/s became prohibitive. An Index Container was introduced to function as an 'Index' for the Data Container. This design change mandated the following data access pattern:

Azure Load Testing is a cloud-based service that lets you test the performance and scalability of your web applications and APIs. You can create and run load tests, analyze and compare the results, and define test fail criteria based on metrics like response time, error percentage, and throughput.
Response time is the time your application takes to respond to a user request. It depends on factors like network latency, server load, and application logic. To measure the performance of your application, you need to look at the response time distribution across different percentiles, which show how many requests are completed within a certain time limit. For example, the 90th percentile response time means that 90% of the requests are completed within that time, and the remaining …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Workloads deployed on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster often need to access Azure backing resources, such as Azure Key Vault, databases, or AI services like Azure OpenAI Service. Users are required to manually configure Microsoft Entra Workload ID or Managed Identities so their AKS workloads can securely access these protected resources.
The Service Connector integration greatly simplifies the connection configuration experience for AKS workloads and Azure backing services. Service Connector takes care of authentication and network configurations securely and follows Azure best practices, so you can focus on your application code without worrying about your infrastructure connectivity.

Service Connector Action Breakdown
 
Before, in order to connect from AKS pods to a private Azure backing services using workload identity, users needed to perform the following actions manually:

Create a managed identity
Retrieve the OIDC issuer URL
Create Kubernetes service account
Establish federated identity credential trust
Grant permissions to access Azure Services
Deploy the application

Now, Service Connector performs steps 2 to 5 automatically. Additionally, for Azure services without public access, Service Connector creates private connection components such as private link, private endpoint, DNS record,
You can create a connection in the Service Connection blade within AKS.

 
Click create and select the target service, authentication method, and networking rule. The connection will then be automatically set up. Here are a few helpful links to for you to learn more about Service Connector.

What is Workspace Replication?
Workspace replication creates a replica of your workspace on another region, that you chose from a set of regions. The original instance of your workspace is referred to as the primary workspace, and the replica on the second region is referred to as secondary.

 However, managed identity can be enabled with the Azure PowerShell command: Set-AzWebApp -AssignIdentity. Furthermore, this command can be executed by utilizing a unique resource type known as deploymentScripts. This resource type can run commands/scripts in the deployment section of the DINE policy, thereby enabling managed identity for app services.

Bienvenidos a este nuevo post en el que te vamos a contar lo que vimos en el tercer episodio de "Inteligencia Artificial y .NET", una serie de charlas en vivo que hacemos cada mes con el equipo de Reactor. 
 
En esta ocasión, tuvimos el placer de contar con cuatro ponentes de lujo que nos enseñaron cómo usar diferentes servicios de Azure para crear aplicaciones de IA con .NET, desde modelos generativos de lenguaje hasta chatbots y análisis de texto. 
 
¿Te lo perdiste? No te preocupes, aquí te hacemos un resumen y te compartimos el video y algunos recursos para que puedas seguir aprendiendo.
 
Contenido


Bruno Capuano mostró cómo cambiar entre modelos locales y en la nube con semantic kernel. 3:40


Francis Nicole mostró cómo usar Custom Vision para entrenar un modelo de detección de imágenes con un personaje de dibujos animados, usando Language Studio y Azure portal. También explicó las métricas de rendimiento y los resultados del modelo. 10:47


Pablo Di Loreto presentó algunos servicios de Azure AI que no son generativos, pero útiles para el procesamiento de lenguaje natural y la IA conversacional, como análisis de texto, extracción de frases clave y respuesta a preguntas personalizadas. También demostró cómo usar Language Studio y Azure Bot Service para crear un chatbot con preguntas frecuentes. 21:21


Luis Beltrán explicó cómo usar Azure Functions y SQL para crear un motor de búsqueda de productos basado en embeddings. También mostró cómo usar Azure OpenAI para generar embeddings y Azure Communication Services para conectar con WhatsApp. 33:17

You can now use Azure Spring Apps to effectively run Spring Batch applications with adaptive cost control. You only pay when batch jobs are running, and you can simply lift and shift your Spring Batch jobs with no code change.
 
Spring Batch is a framework for processing large amounts of data in Java applications. It provides reusable functions for logging, transaction management, job statistics, job restart, skipping errors, and resource management. It also supports high-performance tasks through optimization and partitioning. Introduced in March 2008, Spring Batch is popular among Java developers and is part of the Spring portfolio.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are pleased to announce the public preview of large message support (up to 20 MB) in Azure Event Hubs. Azure Event Hubs is a cloud native data streaming service that can stream millions of events per second, with low latency, from any source to any destination. Event Hubs is compatible with Apache Kafka, and it enables you to run existing Kafka workloads without any code changes.
 
The introduction of large message support is a significant enhancement to our service. Typically, data in streaming scenarios is lightweight, often less than 1 MB, and characterized by high throughput. However, there are instances when messages cannot be divided into smaller segments or chunks.
 
With the new support for large messages, Event Hubs self-serve scalable Dedicated clusters can now accommodate events up to 20 MB in size at no additional cost. This capability allows Azure Event Hubs to handle a wide range of message sizes, ensuring uninterrupted business operations.
 
How to enable large message support for Event Hubs
 
Large message streaming is only supported in Event Hubs self-serve scalable dedicated clusters built out of latest infrastructure. For more details, visit aka.ms/largemessagesupportforeh
 
Being able to stream large messages or events requires no client code changes apart from the change in message or event itself. You could continue sending/receiving messages using any existing event hubs SDK / Kafka API to stream large messages to event hub.
 
We’re all ears for your feedback. To Know more, visit:

Thank you for your continued support. Happy Streaming!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker with message queues and publish-subscribe topics. Sometimes, you may want to delete messages from your queues and subscriptions in a more programmatic manner, for example, to clear out old or unwanted messages from your entities.  
 
We are excited to announce the public preview of Batch Delete, a new feature that lets you delete messages in bulk from your Service Bus entities. Batch delete helps you to delete multiple messages from a messaging entity in one operation, instead of deleting them one by one. Since deletion is done at service side, you don't need to receive the messages before deleting them.
 
To learn more about Batch Delete, visit aka.ms/batchdelete
 
We are sure you will find the Batch Delete feature a significant improvement in Azure Service Bus and encourage you to explore this new addition.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Event Hubs is a cloud native data streaming service that can stream millions of events per second, with low latency, from any source to any destination. Event Hubs is compatible with Apache Kafka, and it enables you to run existing Kafka workloads without any code changes.
 
Recognizing the critical need for local development support for Azure Event Hubs, we’re thrilled to roll out the preview release of the local emulator for Azure Event Hubs. Azure Event Hubs emulator is designed to offer a local development experience for Azure Event Hubs, enabling you to develop and test code against our services in isolation, free from cloud interference.
 
Get started with Azure Event Hubs emulator
 
The emulator is available as a Docker image on Microsoft Container Registry and is platform-agnostic – it can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can either use our automated scripts from the Installer repository or spin up the emulator container using the docker compose command.
 
The emulator is compatible with the latest Event Hubs SDKs and supports basic send and receive operations with Azure Event Hubs via AMQP.
 
For more details, please visit aka.ms/eventhubsemulator
 
We value your feedback and look forward to hearing from you. Your insights will help us enhance the emulator, making it an even more beneficial resource for the Event Hubs community.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, we're excited to announce that compression for Kafka clients is generally available in Azure Event Hubs.
 
Azure Event Hubs is a cloud native streaming service enabling you to build scalable, durable and low-latency workflows with massive volumes of event data with ease. As you onboard more workloads to Azure and build them around Azure Event Hubs, your bandwidth and storage requirements may scale exponentially.
 
Kafka compression can help with this by reducing the data payloads that are stored and transmitted across your architecture, thus reducing network bandwidth and storage requirements and costs, while still keeping the programming model simple.
 
To utilize Kafka compression, you must set the below setting in the Kafka producer configuration properties -
 
 
compression.type = gzip
 
 
 
No changes are required on the Kafka consumer side, since the compression information is made available in the message header and the consumer can automagically uncompress these and make it available for processing.

CI/CD is a system that automates steps in software delivery. For WordPress developers, it means less manual work: once you push updates, the system automatically tests and deploys them. It's like having a assistant that not only speeds up your work but also checks for errors with each update, ensuring your WordPress site runs smoothly. This constant testing and feedback loop means you can fix bugs quickly and improve your site continuously without disrupting the live version. In short, CI/CD makes your development process faster, more efficient, and less error prone.

A staging site, also called as a development site, testing site, or sandbox – is a clone of your actual WordPress website which cannot be accessed by your visitors. This can only be accessed by people who have the staging URL.
 
Why do you need a staging site for your WordPress website?
A staging site is extremely useful when you are working on a WordPress website. It provides a safe area for development, testing, and experimentation. When you are trying out a new plugin, theme or custom code, there are chances that the website might break leading to downtime for your users, or even cause irreparable damage to your website like loss of content and data.

This can pose significant risks, including the potential for revealing sensitive company information or allowing other users' messages to influence the chatbot's responses. That's why it's critical to implement a content filtering mechanism that can inspect messages from users.

Azure Container Apps is a serverless platform that enables you to run containerized workloads without managing the underlying infrastructure. Dynamic sessions adds the ability to execute untrusted code in secure, sandboxed environments at scale.
 
When you build applications that run code or commands from untrusted sources, you must ensure that the code runs in its own isolated environment. Dynamic sessions provide secure, ephemeral sandboxes called "sessions" for running potentially malicious code. Each session runs in its own Hyper-V virtualization boundary — ensuring complete isolation from other sessions and resources.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, and welcome to the recap of our latest video on AI and .NET.
 
In this video, we talked about some of the exciting projects and samples that we have been working on to help you get started with AI using .NET. We also answered some of the questions that you asked us in the previous episode, such as:

How to work with local models
How to use semantic kernel
How to evaluate different models.

 
One of the main topics that we discussed was the AI samples repo, where we are adding artificial intelligence samples for .NET developers. You can find scenarios such as text summarization, chat, data generation, image generation, and more. You can also choose between using semantic kernel or the Azure Open AI SDK to interact with the models.
 
We also showed you how to switch between different models, such as GPT-4, Phi-3 and Llama, using the same code and API. We also shared some links to other resources, such as the Azure Developer .NET Day, where you can learn more about AI, GitHub Copilot, SQL Server, and other topics.
 
Another topic that we covered was the model evaluation sample, which is a work in progress that we are going to present at Build 2024.  (you can check the PR here). The idea behind this sample is to help you evaluate different models that you may want to use or fine-tune for your own applications. We showed you how to use a console application that uses semantic kernel to generate questions and answers, user stories, and other inputs, and then evaluate them using different metrics, such as coherence, groundedness, relevance, and length.
 
The full recording is here,

Best,

Performance testing is not always a walk in the park. Quite often, it can be challenging and time-consuming, especially when dealing with complex and dynamic web applications that rely on JavaScript, AJAX, or other browser-side technologies.
For testing browser latencies under heavy load, JMeter has a built-in component called Web Driver Sampler, which allows testers to use Selenium WebDriver to simulate real browser actions and interactions with web elements. Web Driver Sampler can complement the HTTP Request Sampler, which sends HTTP requests to the server, by adding the browser-side perspective and measuring the rendering time, page load time, and user actions. By running JMeter scripts on Azure Load Testing, you can reliably execute your performance tests without worrying …]]></summary>

What the heck am I talking about? Let me bring you up to speed very quickly (attention, oversimplification ahead!): NSG Flow Logs is a technology that logs every packet going through an NSG: in and out, allowed and dropped. The main issue of NSG Flow Logs is, well, that you need an NSG, and some resources in Azure do not support them. For example, Azure Firewall, VPN gateways or ExpressRoute gateways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
Containerization has become the prevailing choice for hosting and managing Java applications, due to its unmatched portability, consistency, and scalability benefits. However, by default, when running a Java app inside containers, the JVM assumes that the OS memory is shared among multiple applications, so it conservatively claims memory for the Java application.
With Azure Container Apps, we can optimize memory allocation by simply dedicating more memory to the Java app, since only one Java application can run inside a container. This feature is called automatic memory fit, which is enabled by default when you deploy from Java source code or artifact.
In this blog we’ll cover the following:

Redis is an extremely popular in-memory data store that is used as a cache, session store, message broker, and more. One of the features that makes Redis really useful is the ability to set a time-to-live (TTL) value for any key. A key with a TTL value will be automatically deleted from Redis when the TTL expires. This helps reduce memory usage and ensure data freshness.
 
For instance, you might be storing information like inventory or pricing for your e-commerce site in Redis. This is a perfect application for caching in Redis. This type of data will be queried constantly and serving it directly from a database will either slow down your application or make your database implementation very expensive to handle the load!

What is it
When a user authenticates to an app (e.g., MS Entra ID application), a custom claims provider can be used to add claims into the token. A custom claims provider is made up of a custom authentication extension that calls an external REST API (e.g., a Function App), to fetch claims from external systems (e.g., a Database). A custom claims provider can be assigned to one or many applications.
 
Claim: Please imagine it as features (or attributes) that belong to the end user. As it may involve sensitive information within the enterprise, the enterprise owner wishes to store this user information in the on-premises environment, while also hoping to retrieve and utilize it through the authentication process.
