        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Arc for Azure VMware Solution? Simply put, it exposes your Azure VMware Solution resources (VMs, networks, datastores, etc.) to the Azure portal.
 
Using Arc for Azure VMware Solution, those resources can be managed via the Azure portal, even though they are within your vSphere cluster running in an Azure datacenter. Even better, there is no cost to deploy Arc for Azure VMware Solution. More blogs to come on Arc for Azure VMware Solution, but if you want to get some more details check out this video from Jeremiah Megie.
 
First things first. Let’s get Arc for Azure VMware Solution installed into your private cloud.
You will need to collect the following information to input into the PowerShell script, which, if you use it, will make the deployment a bit more straightforward.
 

Subscription ID and Resource Group where the Azure VMware Solution private cloud is deployed.
 Name of the Azure VMware Solution private cloud.
 /28 network segment for the ARC appliance.


The/28 network segment will be an NSX-T segment in the private cloud. Under the covers, the deployment script creates NSX-T segment for use by the ARC appliances. The value must be entered into the script as the gateway to the segment, followed by /28. For example, if 192.168.99.1/28 is entered, there will be a /28 NSX-T segment created with the gateway 192.168.99.1.
 
The other information you can get from the Overview blade of your private cloud.
 

 
Requirements

Your private cloud must have Internet access.
Also, because of the appliance size, ideally you would want to run this script as close to the private cloud, or from a machine inside the AVS Private Cloud.

The script can be found here;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure and Red Hat have had a long-standing partnership to provide customers with best-in-class cloud solutions, such as jointly-supported Azure Red Hat OpenShift, JBoss EAP on Azure App Service, and deployment templates for JBoss EAP on Azure RHEL VM’s. Organizations which are moving existing, on-premises deployments to the cloud at scale need purpose-built tooling that can help automate the process of analyzing their portfolio of applications for cloud readiness. To bridge that gap, we are excited to announce that Microsoft Azure has begun contributing to Red Hat’s Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA), a tool that supports large-scale Java application modernization and migration projects across a broad range of transformations and use cases by automating source-code analysis and providing line-by-line recommendations to migrate your applications to new Java runtimes or the Azure cloud. These contributions to the Red Hat MTA provide service-specific migration recommendations for Azure App Service.
 

 
The collaboration adds rulesets to the open source upstream of the MTA, known as Windup. These new rules search for some common scenarios and provide guidance for accomplishing the task in Azure:

Configuring data sources
Java Key Store usage for certificates
Using Maven to deploy to App Service
Proper use of the file system in Azure
Using Azure Service Bus for JMS
Using Azure Active Directory as an identity provider
… and more!

 
Check out this Video Demo for more information.
 
You can download the web or CLI client of the Migration Toolkit for Applications from the Red Hat’s website or install it as a VS Code plugin.

SaaS infrastructures offer better cost efficiencies by leveraging economies of scale, resource pooling and sharing, and increased utilisation of the infrastructure in general.

One method is to use a private endpoint, also known as a private link, in Azure Static Web Apps. This feature enables developers to connect network isolated backends to Azure Static Web Apps resources for increased security and seamless routing. In this blog post, we'll go through how to set up a private endpoint in Azure Static Web Apps and the advantages it has for keeping your web apps secure.
 
Now a private endpoint, also known as a private link, is a network interface that connects to your virtual network using a private IP address.

WP Admin: Also called the backend, admin panel, or admin dashboard, this is the admin area where you can manage your website. You can edit posts and pages, install themes and plugins, add or remove users, and change website settings.
Frontend: This is the section which is accessible to your users. This is where your users can read blog posts, make purchases, or participate in a forum, depending on the kind of website you build using WordPress.

A relatively common problem is that the WP Admin has low performance even when the frontend works fast for your users. Most performance enhancements that you do makes only your frontend faster. This makes it difficult …]]></summary>

When we create App Service Certificate (Add and manage TLS/SSL certificates - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn) in Azure Portal, sometime we are not using it in the App Service but use it for Azure VM or on-prem VM. Moreover, we will use it in some Azure resources (such as upload the certificate to Azure Application Gateway).
 
However, after you export the App Service Certificate from Azure Portal, when you are going to upload it to Azure Application Gateway or use it in the Azure VM or on-prem VM, you would find out sometimes it would need the "password". But you don't know what the password is for the …]]></summary>

We are seeing two sets of user trends along the Kubernetes adoption curve.

Mobile Azure AD releases increased user capabilities

Updates to Microsoft Intune

Let's look at each of these updates in greater detail.
 
Mobile > Azure Active Directory
 Mobile Azure AD releases increased user capabilities.
 
Building on the initial Azure AD Mobile experience, a new release in December 2022 introduces more user capabilities. This includes enabling users to view their extended profile details and sign-in logs, view other users extended details, search for users within the active tenant, and inviting guest users.
All of these capabilities are contingent on the user having the correct level of permissions to do so. The next release, targeted for late February, will introduce more capabilities for groups.
 

Select the Azure AD card from the Azure Mobile App Home View. Users do not need to have subscriptions to be able to access Azure AD as seen below:

Over these years, the service has evolved, with new options being added and old technologies phased out. We’ve tried to keep the workspace administration UI stable without making too many changes, but it’s time for a refresh.
 
Today we start rolling out a revamped workspace menu that will help you get to the things you need quicker. Key items are now right at the top, where you expect them to be:

 
The new menu is gradually being exposed, so you might not see it immediately.
 
As part of this change, we're also clearly indicating menu options that are in the process of replacement or deprecation. Here are the relevant options and their replacement:

Soon every application on every platform will incorporate some ML capabilities, empowering the application itself and making it smarter.
This is the key reason why ML has been added into the .NET ecosystem a few years back, by creating an open-source framework (ML.NET) which enables developers to train, build and ship custom ML models for a wide range of scenarios (sentiment analysis, forecasting, recommendations and more).

We're going to talk about this phenomenon called dark data and what do you do about it. I hadn't heard about this until I got a chance to talk to our architects, and it was super cool to learn about it and they'll help us understand what it is and what areas I should pay attention to. Let's go find out about dark data and let's go talk to our architects.
 
I think it's time we talk about data and in particular, I want to talk about this thing I think that people are using to scare children at night when they want them to go to bed or something. They talk about dark data, but I don't actually perhaps know what dark data means. I know what …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
Connectors are integration points that help your APIs connect to Microsoft Power Platform. If you have never built a connector before and you enjoy working with APIs, check this article to help you get started. When creating your connector, you are presented with 4 authentication configuration options to ensure successful connection to your API - No Authentication, Basic Authentication, API Key and OAuth 2.0. This article will focus on the configuration of OAuth 2.0 as your authentication type. 

Note: A connector only serves as a proxy for your external service, therefore it must be configured to use the authentication that is implemented by your API.

Of course, we deal with some primitives and basic structures, first of all.
Then we implement some well-known algorithms like bubble sort, Fibonacci number or sqrt function to get used to the language style and expectations.
And now what?

We're going to talk about the relationship between architecture and ambiguity. What do you do when the specs aren't entirely clear, or the plans aren't entirely clear? What people need isn't entirely clear? We're going to discuss that with our architects.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot on the heels of Spring Boot 3.0.2, I am excited to announce the 0.3 release of Spring Modulith.
The release is packed with improvements.
We have tweaked a couple of things that might require your attention and a couple of adapting changes to your code.
The most notable changes are:





GH-114 – We renamed the ….modulith.model package to ….modulith.core. This primarily affects ApplicationModules. Please adapt your imports accordingly.



GH-120 – The documentation support now generates diagram files using the *.puml file extension, as suggested by PlantUML. Please adapt your imports accordingly.



GH-103 – ApplicationModuleInitializer implementations will be triggered upon application startup, in the order following the application module dependency structure (more core ones are invoked first). Also, ApplicationModules exposes a ….getComparator() to order Spring beans that way. Note, that this requires the JGraphT library to be on the classpath (automatically pulled in via the spring-modulith-runtime artifact). See the reference documentation for details.



GH-116 – PublishedEvents now sees events published from asynchronous event listeners, too.



GH-100 – If you’re using AssertJ in your tests, you can now use AssertablePublishedEvents for a more streamlined integration  (for example, assertThat(events).contains(MyEvent.class).matching(…)).



GH-117 – As we incentivize event-based, asynchronous application module integration, the test starter now also pulls in Awaitility.



GH-111 – We now publish aggregated Javdoc.





Find a complete change log in the GitHub release page. We are looking forward to your feedback in the GitHub discussions.]]></summary>

Durable Functions enables you to write long-running, reliable, event-driven, and stateful logic on the serverless Azure Functions platform using everyday imperative code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What’s New?
The Change Tracking and Inventory service tracks changes to Files, Registry, Software, Services and Daemons and uses the MMA (Microsoft Monitoring Agent)/OMS (Operations Management Suite) agent. This preview supports the new AMA agent and enhances the following:

Security/Reliability and Scale - The Azure Monitor Agent enhances security, reliability, and facilitates multi-homing experience to store data.
Simplified onboarding- You can onboard to Virtual Machines directly to Change Tracking (add link) without needing to configure an Automation account. In new experience, there is
Rules management – Uses Data Collection Rules to configure or customize various aspects of data collection. For example, you can change the frequency of file collection. DCRs let you configure data collection for specific machines connected to a workspace as compared to the "all or nothing" approach of legacy agents.

How to get started?
You can onboard to Change Tracking & Inventory with AMA either via Azure Portal or by using Azury Policy (to onboard at scale). To onboard single VM via portal, click on specific VM name from Virtual Machines -> Change Tracking -> Enable using AMA agent (Preview). To know more about the various methods to enable Change Tracking, click here
Onboarding from Single VM view

 
Onboarding via DINE Policies (at scale onboarding)

In the public preview, Change Tracking with AMA supports Window Files, Windows Registry and Software data types. We are working towards facilitating the support of Windows services & Linux Daemons by GA. The data configuration can now be regulated at DCR level now. Click here to know more about Data Collection Rules.
 
You can check out our complete documentation to get more details. We’d love to hear what you like and don’t like about this feature, and where you’d like us to take it. Please click here to Sign Up and try out the new enhancements.]]></summary>

I am sure you aren’t the only one with this question. I used to ask this question too. Does everything about tech have to do with programming?  The short answer is NO! While many tech jobs do require coding skills, there are also many non-technical roles within the tech industry that do not require coding skills. For example, roles in program management, product management, sales, and marketing may not require coding skills, although a basic understanding of technology can be useful.

When load testing an application, this generally is the first step in the user journey.  Supplying client credentials through a UI is not possible when load testing an application, so is evaluating how to implement specific authentication flows available on Azure, as they can be tedious and time consuming as well.

Nowadays, by leveraging cloud features such as scalability, elasticity, and convenience, businesses can deploy, grow, or test an environment in every corner of the world without worrying about building the required infrastructure.
 
Unlike the traditional model, which was based on notifying the service provider to set up the resources for customers in advance, in an on-demand model, cloud providers implement application programming interfaces (API) that can be used by customers to deploy resources on demand. This allows the customer to access an unlimited amount of resources on-demand and only pay for the resources they use without worrying about th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Note that official support for PHP 8 will only be available on Linux, as a result of this App Service will only support PHP 8 on Apps Service Linux instances. For additional information on this topic: PHP on App Service, php.internals: Microsoft Support of PHP on Windows.
 
This article will demonstrate on how to use PHP 8 for App Service Windows, since there would be no official support from Microsoft for it, please use at your own risk.
 
Generally, we are following this post: How to use a Custom PHP runtime for App Service Windows - (azureossd.github.io) to download a custom PHP runtime and map Handler for it.
 
1. Create a new Web app for Windows using any available Runtime stack for Windows.

 
2. After the creation complete, go to Kudu site from Azure Portal:

 
3. Create a new directory and download the PHP runtime(Non Thread Safe Version) from PHP For Windows: Binaries and sources Releases and extract it, in this demo, we use php 8.2.1, the output is as below:
 
 
mkdir php
curl https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/php-8.2.1-nts-Win32-vs16-x64.zip -o php\php.zip
cd php
unzip php.zip
 
 


 
4. Go to Path mappings in configuration. Add a new handler mapping. The extension is "*.php", the Script processor is "C:\home\php\php-cgi.exe". Then save it. All the configuration is done.

 
5. To verify it, we can create an "index.php" file under C:\home\site\wwwroot with below content. The result would look like as below:
 
<?
phpinfo();

To launch SFX in a web browser, browse to the cluster's HTTP management endpoint from any browser - for example https://clusterFQDN:19080. Service Fabric explorer may not load for numerous reasons. Most frequent reasons could be access denied while trying to access or unable to choose the right certificate. Following steps provide some useful insights on investigation steps and mitigations to be followed in such scenarios.1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Symptoms: 
 

  Uploading files using Java SDK class DataLakeFileClient fails to initiate the ADF trigger. 
  Uploading files using Azure Portal initiates the trigger as expected. 
  ADF trigger is configured to ignore empty blobs. 

 
Analysis: 
 

Whenever a file is created using ADLS Gen2 REST API, there are 3 operations called at the backend i.e. CreateFile, AppendFile and FlushFile.
Microsoft.Storage.BlobCreated event is triggered when a blob is created or replaced. Specifically, this event is triggered when clients use the CreateFile and FlushWithClose operations that are available in the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 REST API.
As CreateFile API created a 0 byte blob, the event will not be triggered. 

 
Resolution: 
 

You can initiate the trigger by adding FlushWithResponse method with close parameter as true.

Example: 
 
        boolean close = true;
File file = new File("C:\\Users\\mahmoudsamy\\route.txt");
        fileClient.uploadFromFile("C:\\Users\\mahmoudsamy\\route.txt");
        fileClient.flushWithResponse(file.length(), retainUncomittedData, close, httpHeaders, requestConditions, timeout, contect);
 
Note: Please make sure to pass the correct parameters when using FlushWithResponse to avoid unexpected results.]]></summary>

Instead of trusting that all resources within an organization's firewall are secure, Zero Trust assumes that all access requests, regardless of origin or destination, should be considered as originating from an untrusted network.
 
Guiding principles for the Zero Trust security strategy are as follows: 

Verify explicitly: All available data points must be used to authenticate and approve users, devices, and requests.
Use least privilege access: Users and devices are allowed the bare minimum of access required to execute their functions, and that access is reviewed and revoked when it is no longer required.

The current method does not obey the recommendation of Docker that a docker container should host only one service, and we actually recommend customers use Azure Container App for hosting multiple applications.

We will create a Docker container to have nginx installed and use it as a reverse proxy to redirect the request from external to different applications.

These limits are put in place to ensure that resources are used efficiently and to prevent any one user from consuming too many resources. In this post, we'll take a look at how quotas are affected by Codespaces and provide some suggestions for avoiding the limits on free Codespaces.
 
Before getting into the suggestions, it's important to recognize two key features of how Codespaces effect quotas: 

Every Codespace that has been created (but not deleted) has the potential to deplete your included quota.
Running Codespaces will use both CPU core-hours and storage, while stopped Codespaces will consume your storage quota only.

People have this notion that architects are sitting up in the stone castle speaking their wisdom down to the peasants. Where did that come from and is this a common stereotype?
 
It may help to talk about our own failures. In my journey, early in my career, we thought it would be good to gather a whole group of really talented architects, think of them like chefs and put them in the same kitchen and say if we just funnel all of the organization's problems through this Center of Excellence with the cen…]]></summary>

1. What is Azure Managed Grafana?
Azure Managed Grafana is a data visualization platform built on top of the Grafana software by Grafana Labs. This is a bit different to the Grafana that you download from the grafana.com in the sense of the platform as Azure Managed Grafana is deployed from Azure Portal. 
 
Therefore, you can control and configure the settings of Azure Managed Grafana from the Azure Portal such as limiting access or permission via users by using Azure Active Directory from Access Control (IAM).

But what if you want to test the system to make sure it can handle a desired number of requests per second (RPS) ? For example, you may want to load test a payment gateway service for the number of transactions that can be processed every second. RPS or throughput is a crucial metric that reveals fundamental information about the tested system. Every system has a critical point in terms of throughput. Once the system reaches the critical point, it might keep the throughput around the same level, but the response times go up  or the requests get throttled.

And it’s only possible because of you, dear community. Thank you. You, who have been consistently excellent every week of the year for years and years, are truly the reason for the season, and we appreciate you. This week is no exception! There’s a ton of great content, so let’s kick the year off right!


  
First, I’ll be speaking at the Atlanta JUG on the 16th of this month, by the by, so please join me, and we’ll dive headfirst into Spring in 2023!

Unlike other effects that focus on resource configurations, the denyAction effect will block requests based on intended action, regardless of user permissions.  Today this new effect supports deletions, but it's set up to handle other types of actions in the future. With the at-scale power of Azure Policy and the ability to block delete calls, denyAction allows you to prevent accidental deletions of your critical resources. 
 
Sample denyAction definition that blocks delete calls on any virtual machines: 

 
You are able to create these definitions in Portal or API. All denyAction definitions will have a compliance state of 'Not Started' during preview, and will introduce a new compliance state of 'Protected' for GA.

Therefore, this OpenAPI extension also starts supporting .NET 7 with the isolated worker model. The migration step is as easy as changing the target framework. Update your .csproj file and find the <TargetFramework> node, and change it from netcoreapp3.1 (.NET Core 3.1), net5.0 (.NET 5) or net6.0 (.NET 6), to net7.0 (.NET 7).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Case: In a situation, you observe your EventHub namespace is still incurring the cost, even though you are not doing any operations (read/write/management) on it and your EventHub namespace has no active EventHub instances present.
 
Root Cause of the behavior: 

At the time of creating the Azure EventHub namespace (Basic/Standard/Premium/Dedicated tier), you may have to give pre-purchased units of capacity in terms of Throughput units/Processing units/Capacity units based on the tier you choose. These pre-purchased units of capacity controls throughput capacity of the EventHub namespace.
Among all the other pricing factors, cost will be incurred based on the number of pre-purchased units of capacity (Throughput units/Processing units/Capacity units) at the EventHub namespace level.
Here I have attached a document, referring to the Azure EventHub pricing. Pricing - Event Hubs | Microsoft Azure

 

As the pre-purchased units of capacity (Throughput units/Processing units/Capacity units) are defined at the EventHub namespace level, you will be charged per pre-purchased units of capacity configured hourly, even though there are no active EventHub instances present, and you are not performing any kind of operations on it.

How to mitigate this behavior:

To stop the incurring cost while EventHub is not in use, you may have to delete the EventHub namespace, instead of disabling the EventHub instances.
You can as well export the ARM template to create the same EventHub namespace in future, before deleting the existing EventHub namespace. Export template in Azure portal - Azure Resource Manager | Microsoft Learn]]></summary>

As we all know, the API management service is nothing but a proxy that helps to forward the request and response between the client and the backend server. Ideally, the API Management server will maintain two connections: the one with the client side, and the one with the backend server. The backend server proceeds the request from APIM when SSL/TLS connection is successfully established between APIM and the backend server. However, if any of the elements within the SSL/TLS connection go wrong, the client server may receive a 500 BackendConnectionFailure error with the message ‘The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel.’

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are excited to announce the release of auto-refresh of message counters on the queue overview blades in Service Bus portal experience. This feature updates the queue settings and message counters automatically in specific time intervals selected by the user to provide real time message counts within portal.
 
Queue settings and message counts
 
Every Service Bus queue overview blade on Azure Portal shows valuable information pertaining to the queue settings and messages on the queue. Some of the metrics exposed to users are as shown below:

 

 
Currently, the queue settings and message counts are only updated if the page is voluntarily refreshed by the user. A lot of users are interested in the metrics getting updated automatically when they are in an active queue without voluntarily reloading the page or refreshing the page. This also impacts customers flow introducing a context switch.
 
Enabling auto-refresh of message counters
 
The feature is set to “off” by default. Users are free to turn the Auto-refresh toggle to “on” and select the time interval at which they would like to see the counters refreshed automatically. Turning “on” the auto refresh feature selects 10 seconds refresh by default but users can select from 5 seconds to up to a 1 minute.
 
Steps to enable the feature –
Default – auto refresh is turned “off”

 
Toggle “on” the auto refresh to observe the Refresh after timer selected to 10 seconds by default.

 
Click to select more refresh timing option from the dropdown

Done, after you select, the auto refresh feature will be enabled on all the queues on your service bus namespace.
 
NOTES –

This feature once enabled will apply to all queues within the service bus namespace.
This is a portal specific feature. Hence, users cannot enable/ update/ disable the feature through PowerShell/ CLI]]></summary>

Web Apps - Swap Slot Slot - REST API (Azure App Service) | Microsoft Docs
 
However, we have recently found the following way to monitor the Swap operation and the same API is being used by Azure portal as well to update the Swap status and it's comparatively fast. Please refer to the steps below:
 

First call the POST Slot-Swap API & it will trigger the swap operation as shown below:

https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{SubscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{name}/slots/{slot}/slotsswap?api-version=2022-03-01
 
 

 
2. The above API will have location parameter in Response Headers with Operation Results API call which can be used to continuously poll in a loop until the Response is 200 (Swap completed) or (failure status code in case of swap failure)
 
GET: https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{SubscriptionID}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{name}/slots/{slot}/operationresults/915677b6-ea92-44c9-865b-95cfc693d5bb?api-version=2018-11-01
 
Polling: Swap in accepted/in-progress state:
 

 
Polling: Swap completed:

Log compaction is a way of retaining data in Event Hubs using event key. By default, each event hub/Kafka topic is created with time-based retention or delete cleanup policy, where events are purged upon the expiration of the retention time. Rather using coarser-grained time based retention, you can use event key-based retention mechanism where Event Hubs retrains the last known value for each event key of an event hub or a Kafka topic.

Customer had ~700+ Virtual machines running Kubernetes workloads from two environments (Dev and QA) and we migrated each environment in just a day and ensured that all the servers had their IP retained and their Kubernetes workloads started working exactly the same manner as how it used to work from on-premise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last few years, we’ve received extensive feedback around the need for a better custom logs experience in Azure Monitor Logs. To address it, the team stepped back, analyzed needs in the space, and rebuilt from the ground-up the full custom logs feature set. The features have been in preview for several months now, being vetted by many Log Analytics customers including some of the largest retailers, banks, and healthcare providers in the world. With preview feedback addressed and services now fully scaled out to meet the complex needs of these users and more, we are today excited to announce the revamped custom logs features are now generally available!
 
Today, we are announcing the following:

GA of the Log Ingestion API. This secure, scalable, and flexible API is the path going forward for all custom data ingestion needs.
GA of the Ingestion-time Transformations feature. This feature allows users to customize built-in data streams to parse, enrich, filter, or otherwise tailor incoming data to their specific use-cases.
A pricing for data sent to the system and subsequently dropped in a transformation. A nominal fee per GB dropped will be charged for any data dropped beyond 50% of incoming data, calculated daily. The fee is waived for Azure Sentinel-enabled workspaces. While we're announcing billing today, we will not start charging yet as of this announcement, and will provide at least a 3-month notice before doing so. The Azure Monitor pricing page will be imminently updated with these details.

For those of you who participated in our preview - thank you for your feedback, and to those new to the features - we're excited for you to start using them! To learn more, please start with our docs, and don’t hesitate to reach out should you have any questions!]]></summary>

Java in teaching
Given the sheer size of the amount of Java developers in the world and that's it's used by most of the major companies makes Java a good choice to be taught in academia. There are many resources out there for teaching Java outside of videos series discussed in this article like:
- Learn Java - Dev.java
- Java Tutorial (w3schools.com)
- Java Tutorial - GeeksforGeeks
 
Web development
Many of the world's Java developers works with web and API though so it's a good idea to complement Java fundamentals knowledge with that of web development so looking into the following could be a good idea for your students:

JSP and Servlets, Web Development Using Java Technology For Beginners - GeeksforGeeks
Getting Started | Building a RESTful Web Service (spring.io)
JHipster - Full Stack Platform for the Modern Developer!
Get started with Java on Azure - Training | Microsoft Learn

 
Video series, Java for beginners
Here's a link to the the 23-part video series



 
Here's a selection of videos below from the 23-part series:
 
Maven. 
Maven is a so-called project management and comprehension tool. It allows you to build larger Java apps into projects that can use external libraries, produce something you can deploy and much more. Knowing Maven is a must if you build a bigger app. Gradle is another similar tool to Maven.



 
JShell
a read evaluate print loop for evaluating your code. A great thing for beginners to discover the language and its features.



 
Java testing
Learning to test your code is one of the first things you should know how to do as a developer. This video gives you insight on how you can get started with testing:]]></summary>

Cloud Services (extended support) has the primary benefit of providing regional resiliency along with feature parity with Azure Cloud Services deployed using Azure Service Manager. It also offers some ARM capabilities such as role-based access and control (RBAC), tags, policy, and supports deployment templates.

Spring Boot 3 is here (or will be tomorrow, on the 24th of November, 2022, to be more precise!), bringing a fantastic new Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation engine that supports GraalVM native images. Join me, and we’ll dive deep into the engine and its interactions with the Spring component model. 

This video is a detailed masterclass on the new AOT engine. It starts by examining the everyday usecases of an application developer and delves deeper and deeper into the engine, treating concerns that library and framework developers will care about. 

Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A picture showing .NET
What is .NET MAUI?
.NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) is a cross-platform framework for creating native mobile and desktop apps with C# and XAML. Using .NET MAUI, you can develop apps that can run on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows from a single shared code-base.
Using .NET MAUI, you can create multi-platform apps using a single project, but you can add platform-specific source code and resources if necessary. One of the key aims of .NET MAUI is to enable you to implement as much of your app logic and UI layout as possible in a single code-base.
 
In this blog, we will cover how to Build a Water Consumption Mobile App using .NET MAUI that consumes historical data from a Web API. This solution is part of a project build for .NET Conf Student Zone 2022
 
What will we be doing?
Before you can get started, we need a few things set up first:

Build a Mininal API from scratch to consume in your app
Build your first .NET MAUI App
Add a Consumption.cs class with the following propertiesA picture showing the Consumption.cs class
Add a APIManager.cs class to house the HTTP methods for your APIA picture showing the APIManager.cs class

After the above are added, you can start to:

Consume A Web API – this will show how you to consume the historical data stored in the Web API and display on your mobile app.
Send data to your Web API using the HTTP Post Method (shown in the link above too).

 
We have a dedicated Microsoft learn module that will show you how to Consume and Send Data to your Web API. All of the code for this part of the project and other parts are available on the .NET Student Zone Githup Repositry
 
To see and understand the how to implement this in Visual Studio you can watch my session below.

Finally, if you are curious about where the API data comes from, you can explore the other sessions of the .Net Student Conf and understand how all the different pieces and different technologies of .NET ecosystem are combined together into a single e-2-e project.]]></summary>

We walked through how to set up, run and analyze user loads with Azure Load Testing in part one of this series. In part two we will test different load patterns to show you how simulate them in Apache JMeter. A load pattern specifies how the simulated user load is adjusted during a load test.
While you might run smoke tests regularly with minimal load to avoid regressions, big events present scenarios to consider different types of load testing.
In this article we’ll discuss step loads, spike tests, breakpoint testing and soak testing patterns. Let’s get to it!

This article describes how to get container level stats in Azure Blob Storage, and how to work with the information provided by blob inventory.
 
The approach presented here uses Azure Databricks and is most suited to be used in storage accounts with a huge amount of data.
 
At the end of this article, you would be able to create a script to calculate:

The total number of blobs in the container 
The total container capacity (in bytes)
The total number of snapshots in the container
The total container snapshots capacity (in bytes)
The total number of versions in the container
The total container versions capacity (in bytes)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GitHub is known as the most common DevOps platform to share ideas and collaborate on innovative solutions, but also deploy applications on the Cloud via tools like Visual Studio Code and build easy-to-navigate projects portfolios. In short terms, GitHub is known as the developer's best friend. 
As software and technologies continue to evolve, also Github platform and services are constantly evolving. In this blog post, I wish to show you how the latest Git tools, GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Copilot, can transform and support the world of education.
 
In the following video, you'll be listening about two stories, whose scenarios will be familiar to anyone who is studying or teaching at University, or simply anyone who ever learned a new programming language/framework or prepared a hands-on workshop to deliver. 
The first story's character is Ali, a Data Science teacher at the University of Nowhere. She is preparing for her spring semester course and in particular, she’s preparing a guided tutorial, with a full list of all the instructions her students will need to set up the environment for her Python lab.
The second story is about Mark. Mark is a student at University of Nowhere. He attended the Python data science lab by prof Ali and now he needs to complete the assignment at home. However, he gets stuck at some point.
 
How Github Codespaces and Github Copilot will help them and make their tasks easier? Watch the video below to find out the answer.

You will also know that in some cases the best thing to do is to restore your workload from an existing backup to meet your Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) requirements.  Many organizations have implemented processes to regularly create backups of their workloads, but - in a majority of the cases - we only see the recovery plan that is associated with these backups in action, when problems occur.  
 
In many cases it’s not the lack of an existing backup that complicates things, but rather an insufficient or untested recovery plan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This blog is the complement of another blog which is related to Azure Event Hub Schema Registry. As we known, it’s not supported to migrate Confluent(Kafka) schema registry into Azure schema registry directly. We need to create and manage the scheme registry in the azure event hub separately. The good news is Azure Event Hub supplies multiple client sdks for us to use to serialize and deserialize payloads containing schema registry identifiers and avro-encoded data. In this section, I’d like to share how to use python sdk to send or receive events with schema registry in the Azure Event Hub mostly.  
 
Prerequisites:
1.Create a schema registry group in the event hub portal.
You could refer to this official guidance to create schema registry group.
 
2.Install required python packages with …]]></summary>

Many ISVs (Independent Software Vendors) are exchanging information with devices, applications, services, or humans. In many cases the information passed can be a file or a blob. Each of these ISVs would need to implement such a service. In the past few months, I discussed this capability with several (over 4) different customers, each with slightly unique needs. When I tried to generalize the need, it was clear: they wanted a quick, safe means to exchange files with customers or devices. 
 
So, I tried to translate these asks into user stories: 
 
As a service provider, I need my customers to upload content in a secure, easy-to-maintain micro-service exposed as an API (application programming interfaces) so that I can process the content uploaded and perform an action on it.

I really liked Python as a teaching language and as a first language for many students, due to its relatively low usage of punctuation and its tendency to read like an English sentence.
However, as it is a text-based language, there are still many frustrating ways to mess up a Python program – spelling things wrong, indenting incorrectly, not using the right function for the job, etc. – and new programmers can have a particularly hard time understanding how to fix incorrect code. Teachers and TAs can help students decipher errors, but we’re not always around when they’re coding, especially in large classes (my class size ranged from 1000-2000!).

Many enterprises use a schema registry for schema evolution use cases, such as the Confluent Schema Registry. Starting with version 1.1.x of Spring Cloud Stream until 3.0.0, we provided a schema registry server and AVRO-based schema registry client converters that can reconcile the schema from the schema registry server. Spring Cloud Stream version 3.0.0 moved the Schema Registry components into a top-level spring-cloud project, and Spring Cloud Stream included those in its BOM for the end user applications to consume them. However, this didn’t scale well, and with the 3.2 version, we decided to stop having them as part of the Spring Cloud Stream BOM.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Test driven development (TDD)
Test driven development, or TDD, is a method of directly coupling testing with every part of your daily development. Developers who use TDD typically start developing by first writing a test that fails, and then writing the code that makes the test pass. This approach means that product code is more likely to get high test coverage, and the tests typically come first.
 
Many developers find this pattern useful to help them prioritize good architecture from the start of development, and to stay laser-focused on each part of the functionality they need to implement. This school of thought advocates for testing not being an after-thought of development, but rather a driving force.
 
For example, in the following image, you can see that AddTest is written and fail…]]></summary>

I’ve been visiting with customers and talking to the community here in South East Asia. I was in Malaysia last week, and now I’m in Bangkok, Thailand. I’m near the end of my time here in SE Asia, which makes me sad. I’m dearly going to miss the food and the weather, but time waits for no person, and it’s almost time to go home.

And with time comes a jam-packed roster of new things we can read and learn from. So, without further ado, let’s dive right into it!

Spring Modulith 0.1 M2 released

  
Have you tested your application against the upcoming Spring Boot 3? There’s a ton of amazing new features arriving in this release and you should definitely be kicking the tires now. Remember: Spring Framework 6 is due in about a week’s time and Spring Boot 3 is due less than a few weeks after that! And you know where to go: start.spring.io]]></summary>

But why are they important, and why should you, and your organization, use them on your cloud transformation journey?

To simplify application deployment on Kubernetes, we’re building an experience that brings together a set of tools and AKS add-ons to help you get from source code to running on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using familiar tools and environments like Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and the Azure portal.

What does it take to run an app on Kubernetes?
If you think about it, if you start from a source code of an application, say a microservice, that you want to run on Kubernetes, there are a number of steps and prerequisites:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Move app service resources across subscriptions
Many customers try to migrate across subscriptions, resource groups, and so on. Sometimes they use uploaded certificates in the App service instead of ASC.This blog will be helpful when they migrate App service resources with uploaded certificates. I wrote this blog for testing based on Azure docs.
 
See move across subscriptions 

 
Testing Steps
1. Prerequisites
2. Upload and bind certificates to App Service
3. Do the migration
4. Validate the result
 
1. Prerequisites
- App Service- App service domain: in my case, tlsmigrationtest.com- Add a custom domain to App Service: SSL isn't bound yet

 
2. Upload and bind certificates
Upload certificate (.pfx) and bind certificate to the app service domain.
A. App service > TLS/SSL settings > Private Key Certificates (.pfx) > Upload Certificate

 
B. Upload the certificate

C. Bind certificates
App Service > Custom domains > Add bindings

 
After finishing the above steps, you can see the SSL binding to the App Service domain.

 
3. Migration across subscriptions with uploaded certificates
A. For migration, go to your resource group.
 
B. Before moving resources you must click "show hidden types"
When you check "show hidden types", you can see uploaded certificates.

 
C. Check all App service resources and click move to another subscription
You must move all App Service resources together such as App Service, App service domain, and certificates.
Check limitation Move Azure App Service resources across resource groups or subscriptions - Azure Resource Manager | Microsoft Learn

 
D. Validate the result
Before you migrate app service resources, you can see the validation status.
If you can see succeeded status like below, you will be able to migrate successfully.

 
4. Success migration
Uploaded app service certificates are still bound to the App Service domain in the new subscription.]]></summary>

So you're building serverless applications with Microsoft Azure Functions, but you need to persist data to a database. What do you do about controlling the number of concurrent connections to your database from the function? What happens if the function currently connected to your database shuts down or a new instance comes online to scale with demand?
 
The concept of serverless in general, whether that be through a function or database, is great because it is designed for the modern application. Applications that scale on-demand reduce the maintenance overhead and applications that are pay as you go reduce unnecessary costs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many work apps need the ability to schedule a meeting with others in their organization. Here's how to do it for apps connected to Microsoft 365.
 
Work apps need work data
Work apps serve a specific purpose: they help you track projects, follow orders or manage resources. But rarely do they contain all the information that users need to complete their work. Typically, information about people, their calendars, or communication is stored elsewhere, like in Microsoft 365. And that's a shame because completing a task requires users to switch between different apps, which is detrimental to their productivity. Unless of course, you bring work data into your work app.
 
Find a meeting time and schedule a meeting on Microsoft 365
A common scenario for work apps is to schedule a meeting with others in the organization. While it sounds trivial, the app must be able to access attendees' calendars, find a suitable meeting time and schedule the meeting. And that's where Microsoft Graph comes in.
 
Recently I published an article on freeCodeCamp that shows you how to build an app connected to Microsoft 365 that can find a meeting time and schedule a meeting.
 

 
The app shows you how to make the best use of features available in the Microsoft Graph Toolkit and Microsoft Graph to build a UI that you could integrate with another app.
 
Want to learn more joing our 30 days of Graph challenge runs from November 1-30, 2022. Watch  this short YouTube video to find out why you should participate! 
 
Register for the 30 Days of Microsoft Graph Challenge today.
 
Check it out, and I'm looking forward to hearing what you think!]]></summary>

This is the beginning of a larger series so not all the features you see on the app are complete. We will walk this journey together as we add more production level of deployment into the repo. (Aka. Key-Vault for secrets, Managed Identity and Infrastructure As Code. :))

Impact



Users who have applied the mitigation should take note of the following impact:



No authorized scopes are mapped to the principal (current user) when the Authorization Server (AS) responds to the OAuth2 Access Token Response with an empty or missing scope parameter.



If you are affected by this vulnerability, users will not be granted any authorities beginning with SCOPE_ when the AS does not return scopes. Only the special authority ROLE_USER is given to the principal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure App Service on Linux images using PHP 8.x are now bundled with NGINX instead of Apache. The use of .htaccess files will not work for NGINX as these are used for Apache only. This will require the need to setup a custom startup script and modifying the existing NGINX site configuration.
 

 
Navigate to your App Service via the Azure Portal. Under the Development Tools section, select SSH then Go -->.
Modifying the default site config
You will want to make a copy of the existing configuration and place the file inside the /home/site directory.
 


cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /home/site/default


Once you created a default page as in the previous step, please update the location block to add HSTS Header and create the custom startup script as mentioned below
  
location / {           
index  index.php index.html index.htm hostingstart.html;
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
}
Creating the custom startup script
You will now need to create a custom startup script and save the file as /home/site/startup.sh



#!/bin/bash

cp /home/site/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
service nginx reload


In the custom startup script, we are doing the following:

Overriding the existing /etc/nginx/sites-available/default file with the /home/site/default file.
Reloading the NGINX service to make the updates take effect.

Updating the application settings
Navigate back to your App Service via the Azure Portal. Under the Settings section, select Configuration.
Go over to the General Settings section of the Configuration blade.
For the Startup Command enter the following: /home/site/startup.sh
Save these settings and navigate to your application https://{sitename}.azurewebsites.net/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spring Session 3.1.0-RC1 has been released. The biggest news from this release is that Spring Session Geode was removed which means all of the Spring Modules now belong to the same lifecycle. This means that the Spring Session BOM no longer uses CalVer and instead uses the same version as the remaining Spring Session modules. For example, in this release the version of spring-session-bom is 3.0.0-RC1.

Many companies rely on SAP S/4HANA and an assortment of custom applications, SaaS services, or other commercial solutions to run their business functions. Given this diverse deployment topology, they require their SAP S/4HANA applications to work together with other applications that run on Azure.  A way to achieve this is by integrating both systems using an event-driven approach. You can now configure your SAP Event Mesh (SAP’s event broker) to send SAP events to Azure Event Grid more easily than current alternative approaches. This way, your applications on Azure can react to system state changes that originate in an SAP backend application. This approach avo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Backup recently launched the public preview of immutable vaults that can help you protect your backup data better against ransomware attacks and other malicious actors. Immutable vaults protect your backups by blocking any operations that could lead to loss of recovery points if misused. Further, you can lock the immutability setting to make it irreversible, which can prevent malicious actors from disabling immutability and deleting backups.
Immutability is supported for Recovery Services vaults as well as Backup vaults.
How it works
Backup data stored using Azure Backup is not accessible directly and the only way to access or manage this data is through the vault. Immutable vaults help you by preventing any operations that, if used by malicious actors, could lead to the loss of back…]]></summary>

Show upcoming meetings for a Microsoft 365 user
Recently, I published an article on freeCodeCamp that shows you how you can build in just 10 minutes a simple personal assistant that shows upcoming meetings for the signed-in user.

 

 
Showing upcoming meetings is a common scenario when integrating Microsoft 365 in work applications. It shows you how to get information from the user's calendar and check their availability for a particular time slot. And it's also a great way to get started with building apps on Microsoft 365.
 
The tutorial shows you the basics of setting up auth in a single-page app and using the Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK to connect to the Microsoft Graph API. It also demonstrates working with calendar views and formatting dates.This is just one of many scenarios and types of apps that you can implement on Microsoft 365. For more information about the type of data and insights stored on Microsoft 365 that you can tap into, check out the Microsoft Graph API documentation.
 
Give it a try, and we're looking forward to hearing what you think.
30 Days of Microsoft Graph is a gamified learning experience for beginners to challenge themselves on building apps with Microsoft Graph and JavaScript based on the Top Microsoft Graph Scenarios, for a chance to win exciting prizes.

 
The challenge will start on November 1st and end on November 30th. Register for the 30 Days of Microsoft Graph Challenge today: https://aka.ms/30DaysOfMSGraph/Register]]></summary>

I’m in sunny Singapore, then off to Malaysia and Thailand. It’s the first time I’ve been to any of these places since 2019! How good it is to be back! I’ve so missed it.

The Spring team is busy preparing for both Spring Boot 3 (and the Spring Framework 6 release that underpins it) and SpringOne 2022. Have you booked your ticket for SpringOne 2022 yet? It’s going to be held in sunny San Francisco, and - of course - it’ll be the absolute best place to learn about Spring Framework 6, Spring Boot 3, GraalVM, the new Ahead-of-time compilation engine in Spring Boot 3, and more. Also, it’s a rare chance to hang out with the Spring team proper.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a function app, usually we use appsetting AzureWebJobsStorage to connect to storage. This blog shows you how to configure a function app using Azure Active Directory identities instead of secrets or connection strings, where possible. Using identities helps you avoid accidentally leaking sensitive secrets and can provide better visibility into how data is accessed.
 
This will not work if the storage account is in a sovereign cloud or has a custom DNS.
 
Below are the steps to do configuration.
 
1. Enable system assigned identity in your function app and save it.

 
2. Give storage access to your function app. Search for Storage Blob Data Owner, select it.

 
 

 

 
 
 
3. If you configure a blob-triggered function app, repeat the step 2 to add Storage Account Contributor and Storage Queue Data Contributor roles which will be used for blob trigger.

 

 
 
4. Return to Access Control (IAM), click Role assignments, search for your function app name to confirm the roles are added successfully.

 
 
5. Navigate to your function app. Select Configuration and edit AzureWebJobsStorage. Change the name to AzureWebJobsStorage__accountname.  Change the value to your storage account name. (The new setting uses a double underscore (__), which is a special character in application settings.) 

 
 
6. Delete the previous AzureWebJobsStorage. Then you will find your function app still works fine.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our ISV partners have been asking for a way to provide an easy way to package their Kubernetes based solutions into the Marketplace and we're excited to announce K8s Apps to meet their needs.
 
ISV's are excited about this because it allows them to transact their offers in the Azure Marketplace via CI/CD.  This includes 48 hour publishing turnaround, automated security vetting and a self-service experience.  Customers look forward to the easy deployment, automated patching and using these offers to decrement their MACC.
 
Since then, a lot of information has come out and our partners are looking for guidance on how to get started.  I've recorded this End-To-End video which walks through the steps of an ISV Creating and Publishing an Offer as well as a Customer Purchasing the offer.  This is a more detailed version of the demo seen at Ignite.
 



 
 
All of the code available for the Minecraft As A Service demo is on GitHub.
 
If you are an ISV and interested in getting started in the K8s Apps in the Marketplace, I recommend the following:
 

Read the blog for the Ignite Announcement
Watch the full demo video
Fill out the Public Preview Invite Form
Review the Mastering Container Offers on-demand course and workshop
Register for the Marketplace Summit

 
When you're ready to publish your offer to the marketplace, these docs will guide you:

Create the Offer
Prepare your Technical Assets
Create/Publish offer in Partner Center
Deploy the Offer

Come join some of our other partners that have already taken the leap!

Tetrate Istio Distro
Elastic Cloud

I hope this helps you on your journey into K8s Apps on the Azure Marketplace and we'll see your offer available for customers soon.]]></summary>

I did a presentation with my friend and hero James Ward on Spring and Kotlin (that was voted third most-liked talk at a show with more than 250 speakers!) That was a personal career highlight for me - it’s not often you get to win and have fun in life. And, as if that wasn’t awesome enough, this week I am in Las Vegas, NV, for JavaOne! Fingers crossed, this week will go smoothly, too! Both Devoxx and JavaOne are the first such shows since at least before the pandemic. It’s been a very long time in coming and I’m elated, overjoyed, to be able to be here.

And, of course, I’m super excited about SpringOne 2022! Also, the first in-person show of its kind since before the pandemic! It’s going to be amazing. Have you registered? If not, you might consider using this registration code - S1VM22_Advocate_200.

And this week’s busy roundup reflects the usual flurry of activity on the Spring team as we ready releases for our end-of-November timelines for Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, which means we’ve got a ton of stuff to get into this week, so let’s!

The purpose of this blog is to share the one of the failure scenarios that users may encounter during the deployment of Private Endpoint via Managed Application or ARM template.
 
Symptom:
In complete mode (Deployment modes - Azure Resource Manager | Microsoft Learn), the resources in resource group that are not specified in the template will be deleted by Resource Manager. However, during the deployment of Private Endpoint, the Network Interface (NIC) is being generated automatically as a separate resource with random given name so this means that this NIC cannot be defined in the template. As a result, the NIC is not defined in the ARM template will be deleted in the complete mode of deployment, while this action will be blocked because the Private Endpoint is currently referenc…]]></summary>

It’s Sunday the 16th of October as I write this and I’m winging my way to sunny Las Vegas, Nevada, where I’ll be attending (and presenting at) the first JavaOne show in years! It didn’t exist as the JavaOne we know and love for years, even before the pandemic interrupted life as we know it worldwide. So this isn’t just the first JavaOne since 2019, it’s [the first JavaOne since 2017](https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/04/oracle-kills-java-one/_! I can’t wait to be there, to see the amazing community, to soak up the sun and fun with my teammates and friends in the ecosystem. And we want to see you, too.

There are a few of us doing talks from the Spring team and we’d love to see you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, Spring fans! I was just at Devoxx in Belgium, where hundreds of experts from across the Java ecosystem converged for the first time since 2019 to deliver their biggest and best. 

I could do a proper trip report, but I really just came here to point you to two talks from two of my amazing teammates, Stéphane Nicoll (@snicoll) and Brian Clozel (@bclozel), who have been very hard at work on both Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, both of which will land by the end of November, 2022. These are brand new generations of the framework, implying huge new paradigms and new opportunities for developers. 

This first is a broader, whirlwind tour of the new features in Spring Framework 6 (which bubble up into Spring Boot 3).


This second one introduces the new ahead-of-time (AOT) support in Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, which makes it trivial to build GraalVM native images.



NB: please ignore the metadata for the YouTube videos. Both talks feature both speakers, and there is no mention whatsoever of React and JavaScript and the like. I think that was a metadata issue with the publication of the videos on YouTube, which will hopefully be resolved. 

Enjoy! 

If you missed this event, that’s OK - there’s still time to join the Spring team and larger Java ecosystem for SpringOne, being held 6-8 December, 2022, in sunny San Francisco, CA, 94105! Join us!

The easiest way to connect your app to Microsoft 365
Using Microsoft Graph Toolkit is the easiest way to connect your app to Microsoft 365. Toolkit's components help you retrieve relevant data from Microsoft 365 and show it in your app in any way you want. And with toolkit's authentication providers, setting up auth is a matter of adding a few lines of code. Never again fiddle with setting up a login, handling access tokens, building web requests, and dealing with errors.
 
Learn Microsoft Graph Toolkit interactively
To help you learn what Microsoft Graph Toolkit has to offer and how you'd use it in your app, we recently released a new learning path on Microsoft Learn. By following a few learn modules you'll learn everything that you need to know to use the toolkit in your app. But that's not all.
Thinking about the different ways in which people learn, we've launched an experiment - an interactive code tour that you can follow to add Microsoft Graph Toolkit to a React app.

 

 
By following the instructions in the tour, you gradually extend an empty React app with Microsoft Graph Toolkit turning it into a true Microsoft 365 app. What's cool about this code tour, is that it puts the code of your app in the center. Rather than reading long-form, you're in the code and get relevant, and in-place tips for building your app.
 
The Microsoft Graph Toolkit React code tour is a great way to quickly experience how you'd use the toolkit in a React app. We'd love it if you gave it a try and told us what you think. Shall we consider building tours for other technologies and scenarios?

TLS is a standard cryptographic protocol that ensures privacy and data integrity between clients and services over the Internet. For more information about TLS, see Transport Layer Security.
 
Azure Service Bus supports choosing a specific TLS version for namespaces. Currently Azure Service Bus uses TLS 1.2 on public endpoints by default, but TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are still supported for backward compatibility.
 
Azure Service Bus namespaces permit clients to send and receive data with TLS 1.0 and above. To enforce stricter security measures, you can configure your Service Bus namespace to require that clients send and receive data with a newer version of TLS. If a Service Bus namespace requires a minimum version of TLS, then any requests made with an older version will fail. 
 
Thanks to your input and feedback, this feature is now in general availability.

Most customers tell us they prefer to run a larger number of smaller clusters, but some very large workloads can be run much more efficiently on bigger clusters. To support this, we have increased the number of nodes you can have in a single Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster from 1,000 to 5,000.  This will allow you to reduce the number of clusters needed to run your workloads, reducing the operational overhead needed to support application teams.
 
When using the uptime SLA you can request a quota increase across all node pools in the cluster by raising a support request.

Modern applications run on complex environments using a plethora of cloud services, and it can take days—if not weeks—for developers to get access to the resources they need. On top of that, organizations lack centralized visibility into environments, making it hard to ensure they run securely and in compliance with corporate policies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Java Profiler for Azure Monitor Application Insights is now in Public Preview. It is a new capability in Azure Monitor to help Java developers troubleshoot performance issues and uncover performance bottlenecks. 
  
Under the hood, it uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to profile your application using a customized configuration.  For additional context, JFR is a tool that collects profiling data of running Java applications, and it is integrated into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). JFR comes with little to barely noticeable overhead cost which makes it great to run on heavily loaded production deployments. 
  
Using the customized configuration, you can generate profiles in two ways: 
  

Automated Profiling - Configure CPU and memory thresholds to automatically trigger a profile recording. 
On-demand Profiling - Use “Profile Now” to run near real-time profile recording. 

 To try out the Java Profiler:
 

Enable Azure Monitor Application Insights using v3.4.1 jar file or later. 
Enable the profiler using the java profiler installation guidance and set your CPU/Memory triggers for automatic profiling. 
Click the "Profiler" button on the Application Insights Performance Blade and click "Profile Now" for an on-demand profile. 
Download the profiling session when it becomes available (it may take about 5 minutes to show up in Portal). 
View and analyze the profile with Java Mission Control (JMC) or another tool (java profiles are not currently viewable in Portal). 

  

 
  
Java Profiling is in preview today and can be enabled across all your JVMs. Even better, it is included in Application Insights for no additional cost. Try it out and let us know what you think!]]></summary>

What wasn’t clear was how to set a desired communication protocol and maintain this at scale, until now.
 
To prevent bad actors from accessing or disrupting sensitive data as it moves through the internet, we have relied on various cryptographic protocols over the years, namely Secure Socket Layers (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS). As weaknesses were discovered, new versions of SSL and then TLS were created and although technologies have evolved, so have the tactics of hackers and other cyber criminals.
 
As of 2020, TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer supported. TLS 1.2 is required to maintain secure connections and …]]></summary>

Sometimes, we may encounter the following error when accessing wordpress website.
 

 
It is very easy to understand that there is something wrong with the connection between the website and database. But how can we find more detailed information regarding this error?
 
We can enable WordPress debugging mode to check the detailed error message. The steps are as below.
 
1.Login to the newui of the scm site.(https://{sitename}.scm.azurewebsites.net/newui)
2.Click File Manager and find the wp-config.php file under site/wwwroot folder.
 

  
3.Change "define( 'WP_DEBUG', false);" to "define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );" in wp-config.php file. We can edit it directly from the newui portal.
 
With this change, you can try to access the wordpress site again without restarting the app service. You will see the detailed error message when accessing the website.

 
You may see below possible error messages. I added some suggestions for each kind of error for your reference.

Azure Storage supports soft delete to protect your data for Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. Soft delete allows you to recover data that has been deleted within a retention period. With public documentation Manage and restore soft-deleted blobs - Azure Storage | Microsoft Learn, we can recover a particular soft deleted file via portal, code and Powershell script. The documentation provides some Powershell examples to recover all soft-deleted objects. In some scenarios, you may want to undelete with Powershell scripts to undelete many blobs with certain conditions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're a web developer, there's an exciting opportunity for you to build applications for Microsoft 365, which many organizations across the world use for work. Let me show you, how you can use your existing skills and build your first application that integrates with Microsoft 365 in just 10 minutes.
 
What's Microsoft 365?
Microsoft 365 is a set of applications, like Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Word, or SharePoint, that organizations use for work. Every day, millions of people use Microsoft 365 to chat, meet, send emails, create documents, and more.
 
But Microsoft 365 isn't just a set of apps. It's also a platform that enables developers, like yourself, to build applications. These apps can tap into data and insights stored on Microsoft 365 and bring them into people's workflows.
 
Building for a platform
Building for a platform isn't trivial. It comes with all kinds of specific knowledge you have to have like what tooling, SDKs, and APIs to use, how to integrate your app, and finally how to package and distribute it. What many people forget though, is that you don't have to learn everything about everything at once. Often, you can start simple and build up from there.
 
Build your first Microsoft 365 app in just 10 minutes
Recently, I published an article on freeCodeCamp that shows you how you can build your first Microsoft 365 app in just 10 minutes.

 

 
Sure, the app is simple and doesn't do much, but when building it, you'll learn the fundamental concepts of building apps on Microsoft 365. And after these 10 minutes, you'll have a functional app that works and retrieves data from Microsoft 365, and which you can use as a starting point for more complex apps.
 
Give it a try, and we're looking forward to hearing what you think.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overview
In this How To, I will show a simple mechanism for reading items from CosmosDB using Azure API Management (APIM). Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed, serverless NoSQL database for high-performance applications of any size or scale. APIM is a API management service offering many features for manging APIs and exposing backend services.
 
Example Use Case
The example use case involves using CosmosDB to maintain a list of information and exposing the information using APIM as a public RSS feed. This will provide a user to illustrate APIM caching and transformation, and how APIM can call CosmosDB securely using managed identity.
 
Setup
The first step is to provision a CosmosDB and APIM service instance. In my resource group, I created the following services:

        <updated>2022-10-05T02:50:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scenario
Goal: Blob storage can access only from the app service.So, you want to set the blob storage firewall for inbound traffic.
 
Blob storage firewall limitation in this scenario
1. IP address
 IP network rules have no effect on requests originating from the same Azure region as the storage account.
 See Grant access from an internet IP range 
2. Service tag
 There isn't an App service tag.

 
ps. When clients request blob storage through app service, blob storage receives not App service IP but Client IP.
 
Workaround
1. Add IP address when app service and storage are located in a different region.
When resources are located in a different region, the IP address firewall setting works.
2. Firewall with Virtual Network
When blob storage uses VNet firewall, app service must be integrated with VNet.
If you want to read what is VNet integration, see VNet integration 

 
Before setting VNet integration, you must check limitations.
Integrate your app with an Azure virtual network - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn
 
1. Set Vnet Integration on the app service
Add VNet to your app service.
I use "firwall-storage-vnet" VNet as below.
 

 
2. Blob storage firewall setting with VNet which is integrated with app service

3. If you use a function app, please add WEBSITE_CONTENTOVERVNET = 1
A value of 1 enables your function app to scale when you have your storage account restricted to a virtual network. 
You can see the detail about this setting website_contentovervnet]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Static Web Apps automatically builds and deploys dozens of frontend frameworks, one of them is Nuxt. Today, we're excited to share that you can deploy Nuxt 3 applications with universal rendering to Azure Static Web Apps.
 
While Nuxt 2 is known for its ease of use, Nuxt 3 brings even faster performance and improved developer experience with a thrilling new set of underlying technologies and features. With the release of Nuxt 3’s release candidate in April 2022, developers witnessed a complete re-architect of the framework. Nuxt 2 apps that have been upgraded with Nuxt Bridge also work with Azure Static Web Apps.
 
What’s new in Nuxt 3? 
 

Zero-configuration deployment of Nuxt 3 and Nuxt Bridge applications with universal rendering to Azure Static Web Apps 
API routes support for automatic generation from server API and middleware directories 
Vue 3 support including composition API with imported functions for better code re-usability 
Nitro Engine, a full stack server that allows deployment of output on Node.js, serverless, edge-side rendering, or as static 
Vite, a frontend tooling that features fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimizes assets for production 

Universal rendering vs static rendering
 
Previously, you were able to deploy a static rendered Nuxt app on Azure Static Web Apps, where the entire app is pre-generated as static content. However, Nuxt 3 also supports universal rendering, which provides the performance and search engine optimization of server-side rendering while still enabling client-side interactivity.
 
With Nuxt 3's support for Azure Static Web Apps, you can now deploy sites with universal rendering. 
 
To learn more, check out the Nuxt 3 site deployment with universal rendering on Azure Static Web Apps documentation that also includes a tutorial.

Adaptive sampling is enabled by default.
Fixed-rate sampling is not supported.
Ingestion sampling only applies when no other sampling is in effect. Therefore, this is also disabled by default in the wake of point #1 above.

 
 
If you expect data (invocations) under Monitor but do not find it as shown in screenshot below, you have either changed Host.Results category to Warning (or above) level; or your application telemetry is getting sampled. To fix the former, open Host.json file and change the Host.Results category to Information level.
 
{
  "logging": {
    "fileLoggingMode": "always",
    "logLevel": {
      "default": "Information",
      "Host.Results": "Information",
      "Function": "Error",
      "Host.Aggregator": "Trace"
    }
  }
}
 
 
If Host.Results category is already set at Information level, disable telemetry sampling as the next step.
 

 
 
 
To disable the sampling, set "isEnabled": false in host.json file as shown below -
 
{
  "logging": {
    "applicationInsights": {
      "samplingSettings": {
        "isEnabled": false
       }
    }
  }
}
 
After disabling sampling, you can confirm it by running a query similar to the following; RetainedPercentage should show 100%.
 

 
 
 
 
At this point, the function invocations should start appearing under Monitor on Azure Portal UI.]]></summary>

The purpose of this developer's quick start guide is to help you build cloud-native Java applications in Azure. You’ll gain insights about using NoSQL and why you should consider Azure Cosmos DB, our fully managed, distributed NoSQL database service on Azure. 
These insights are designed to be useful, starting with a NoSQL background or coming into a project with a relational mindset. Data isn’t the only thing involved in an application, and this guide will take you through working with other Azure services that integrate well with Azure Cosmos DB. 
You’ll learn how to host Java applications in Azure Spring Apps or set up notifications with Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps.

Node.js has two module systems:
1)  CommonJS modules and
2)  ECMAScript modules.
 
1) CommonJS: The de facto standard for modules in Node.js currently  is CommonJS. CommonJS modules are defined in normal .js files using module.exports or .cjs.
Modules can be used later within other .js files with the require() function.
Import using require (Common JS) :
 
 
// foo.js
module.exports = function() {
  return 'Hello foo!';
}

// index.js
var foo = require('./foo');
console.log(foo()); // Hello foo!
 
 
 
to run this example:
 
 
 
node index.js

Security Challenges with Passwords
 
Passwords should be used with caution, and developers must never place passwords in an unsecured location. Many Java applications connect to backend data, cache, messaging, and eventing services using usernames and passwords, or other sensitive credentials such as access tokens or connection strings. If exposed, the passwords could be used to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information such as a sales catalog that you built for an upcoming campaig…]]></summary>

Also, as Terraform is run from the cloud it automatically uses information from the current Azure subscription and you can securely save the Terraform state file in Azure Storage. Best of all, you can still do all your authoring of Terraform from VS Code. 
 
Btw, the last section on the Terraform state file in Azure storage is documented here on Microsoft Docs, however I have captured the complete solution here.
 
Four easy steps:

Connect to CloudDrive (Azure Files Share)
Copy files from this reop to Azure CloudDrive
Setup the Terraform State in Azure Blob Storage
Sign into Azure Cloud Shell from VS Code

To get things setup remotely, you need a few things. 
 
Five easy steps:

Install Terraform locally
Install Bash (optional)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can use client side decryption of properties on Azure Spring Apps by following the steps below:
Add the encrypted property in your .properties file in your git repository.It would look like:


message={cipher}f43e3df3862ab196a4b367624a7d9b581e1c543610da353fbdd2477d60fb282f


Update the Config Server on Azure Spring App to use the git repository which has our encrypted property. You could do it directly from Azure Portal or use Azure CLI:
az spring-cloud config-server git set -n myspringcloud --uri <git_repo_url>

In your Spring Boot application, add the decryption key in the bootstrap.yml file. (You would need to create it if it does not exist)


encrypt:
  key: somerandomkey



[This is the key you would have used in order to encrypt your property earlier]Now, add some code to get the value of the encrypted property.


package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class TestController {

    @Value("${message:default}") 
    String message;

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String hello() {
        return message;
    }

}



Create an App, or deploy to an existing one.
az spring-cloud app create -n <appName>

 
Deploy your app.
az spring-cloud app deploy -n appName --jar-path <location_of_jar>

 
Assign a public endpoint (or use the Test Endpoints)
az spring-cloud app update -n appName --assign-endpoint true

 
Access your application to view the value.
https://<myspringcloud>-<appName>.azuremicroservices.io/

 
(Optional) You can check the encrypted values on the Config Server by following the steps mentioned in thisdocumentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-cloud/how-to-access-data-plane-azure-ad-rbac]]></summary>
