        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overcoming Asymmetrical Routing in Azure Virtual WAN: A Collaborative Journey
In the rapidly evolving landscape of cloud networking, professionals often encounter complex challenges that demand innovative solutions. This blog post delves into a recent scenario involving Azure Virtual WAN (VWAN), where a team embarked on a collaborative journey to address asymmetrical routing issues. This case study not only highlights the technical intricacies but also underscores the importance of collaboration and knowledge sharing in the tech community.

 
 
The Challenge:
The core issue revolved around asymmetrical routing within an Azure VWAN architecture, which included two hubs located in different regions. The primary goal was to ensure seamless connectivity between a Palo Alto NGFW in one hub and Panorama in another, without disrupting the existing VPN default routes. The asymmetry in routing was particularly problematic for traffic intended to reach Panorama from the NGFW, as the return traffic defaulted through the VPN, deviating from the desired path.

The configuration issue with the firewall is acknowledged as a known issue. The only mitigation provided is documented in Microsoft's official documentation. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/whats-new#known-issues

 

 
Possible solutions:

Exposing the Panorama to the public IP and creating a relay subnet for routing / advertising summary route from NCUS to SCUS for NCUS subnet (10.193.0.0/16)]]></summary>

Historically, data extraction from unstructured documents was a manual and tedious process. It consisted of a combination of constant human involvement or the incorporation of tools that were limited, due to the various document formats, inability to recognize font color and styles, and the document’s data quality being substandard.
 
These methods were time-consuming and often resulted in errors due to the complexities involved in understanding and interpreting unstructured data. The process also lacked scalability, making it difficult to process large volumes of documents efficiently.
 
With the advancements of LLMs, the ability to extract data from unstructured documents has significantly improved and offers users a more adaptable solution based on their indivi…]]></summary>

Java applications often face startup delays due to their runtime initialization and class loading processes. In the cloud-native era, applications start and stop more frequently, with an increasing need for scale-out to accommodate dynamic traffic demands, making this issue even more prominent. To mitigate this, CRaC (Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint) offers a solution to this challenge by allowing applications to be checkpointed and restored, thus avoiding lengthy startup time after the first initialization. Based on the experiment on the Spring PetClinic project project, we observed a 7x improvement in startup speed after enabling CRaC on Azure Kubernetes Service.

As you may be aware, the ALZ team release cadence is now on quarterly basis to help customers and partners manage change in their environments. Additionally, based on feedback from our community, partners and customers that we will only introduce breaking changes every half-year, this release, being 3 months since the last breaking change (FY24 H2), therefore does not contain any breaking changes.

Currently, IT infrastructure stores and maintains data assets, even though IT doesn't own or use the data.  
There's a disconnect between how data needs to be discovered and maintained within the business, and the teams that maintain it.  
Without standardized procedures for data governance, data handling often relies on manual processes, leading to inefficiencies, data loss, insufficient data protection and higher operational costs. 
Microsoft Purview is designed to help enterprises get the most value from their existing information assets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scenario
Customers follow the Microsoft doc to create CMK encrypted objects (data source, index etc.), but get the 500 Internal Server Error:
{'error':{'code':'','message':'Could not use key vault key to wrap/unwrap the encryption key. {\\'Message\\':\\'An error has occurred.\\'}'}
Possible Causes

The key vault host is incorrect, e.g. incorrect key vault domain.

Action: check the keyVaultUri in the Json payload.


The key vault host is inaccessible to search. For example, the key vault has public network access disabled but does not have a shared private link (SPL) configured from search. 

Action: check the SPL configurations or create a SPL. 



Note that if the key vault Uri is correct or accessible, the error message due to a wrong key vault key name or version in the JSON payload is slightly different. The error message has the complete key vault key path.
{"error": {"code": "","message": "Could not use key vault key https://keyvaultname.vault.azure.net:443/keys/wrongkeyname to wrap/unwrap the encryption key. The key vault key cannot be found."}}]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Route Summarization?
Route summarization, also known as route aggregation, is a technique used in networking to combine multiple routes into a single, summarized route. This helps reduce the size of routing tables and simplifies the routing process.

Data transmission and access control are critical aspects of security that need to be considered. SSH tunneling is a technique that can help achieve secure communication between different components of an application or solution. SSH tunneling creates an encrypted channel over an existing SSH connection, allowing secure data transmission between a local machine (SSH client) and a remote server (SSH server).
In this article, we will show how to set up SSH tunneling between containers running in the cloud that need to communicate with downstream resources via an SSH server hosted in a cloud VM.

A function transforms input to output, making it a lightweight choice for scheduled tasks, reminders, order processing and other actions that don’t require fault tolerance more complex than simple retries. Plus, functions run on a cloud host’s infrastructure, scaling in and out on demand, and you only pay for the resources you consume.
 
But what if you have workflows that need more reliability and fault tolerance than a short-lived function provides? What if your scenario includes longer-running tasks or your business logic needs the output of one function as the input to another?

However, deploying these containerised apps to Azure Container Apps (ACA) is a different story.
 
Since its release in May 2023, Azure Developer CLI (azd) has evolved significantly. azd nowadays even automatically generates Bicep files for us to immediately provision and deploy applications to Azure. With this feature, you only need the azd up command for provisioning and deployment.
 
Throughout this post, I'm going to discuss how to provision and deploy .NET apps including Azure Functions to ACA through just one command, azd up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few-shot prompt is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) where a model is given a small number of examples (or “shots”) to learn from before generating a response or completing a task. This approach is particularly beneficial because it allows the model to understand and adapt to new tasks with minimal data, making it highly efficient and versatile. By leveraging few-shot prompts, users can achieve high-quality results without the need for extensive training datasets, thus saving time and computational resources. Additionally, this method enhances the model’s ability to generalize from limited examples, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.

By retaining deleted data for a specified period, it ensures data integrity and availability, even in the event of human error. However, restoring data in the soft delete state can be more labor-intensive, as the undelete API must be called for each individual deleted blob. Currently, there is no option to bulk undelete all blobs.
 
In this blog, we provide a sample C# code that will help you restore soft-deleted data efficiently. The code leverages multiple threads to expedite the restoration process, making it particularly effective if you have a large number of blobs to restore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with the Service Bus Explorer in the Azure portal, you may want to grant different permissions to different users, depending on their role and responsibility. For example, you may want to allow some users to send messages to a queue, but not receive them. Or you may want to restrict access to a specific queue, topic, or subscription, but not the entire namespace.
 
To address this challenge, we are excited to announce granular permissions for Service Bus Explorer. To use granular permissions, you need to use Microsoft Entra authentication, and assign one of the following roles, either on the namespace level or on the entity level.

Service Bus Data Owner; Allows to execute both send and receive operations.
Service Bus Data Sender; Allows to execute send operations.
Service Bus Data Receiver; Allows to execute peek, receive, and purge operations.

In case you use a role which doesn’t have send or receive permissions, or you do not have permissions on the specific entity, the unavailable operations will be disabled. Furthermore, a notification will be shown showing which permissions are missing.
 

 
For more information on using the Service Bus Explorer, you can check our documentation.]]></summary>

This means that even if we can use identity-based host connections to replace the AzureWebjobsStorage, which uses a SAS token, we still cannot remove the file share connection strings (WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING) that also rely on a SAS token. Therefore, we are unable to disable the SAS token in the storage account.
 
For now, when creating function apps in the consumption/EP plan, we have the option to create an app without Azure File. In this scenario, we can bypass the SAS token requirement for Azure Files and solely utilize managed identity to access the storage account.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the support for Azure API Management (APIM) STv1 platform ends on August 31, 2024, it’s crucial for customers to migrate their instances to the STv2 platform. This blog will focus on the new migration options introduced to facilitate this process, as outlined in the attached document.
 
Why Migrate to STv2?
With the end of support for STv1, instances on this platform will no longer have a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Migrating to STv2 ensures continued support and access to the latest features and improvements in Azure APIM.
 
New Migration Options
Over the past year, several limitations in the migration process have been addressed to make it easier for instances injected into a virtual network. Here are the key improvements:

Disaster Recovery (DR) and ransomware protection are critical concerns for organizations today, as the frequency and cost of attacks continue to rise. Our customers demand comprehensive and cost-effective options to safeguard their critical workloads without compromising application performance.
 
AVS collaborates with leading technology companies, such as JetStream Software, to deliver advanced DR solutions that offer both near-zero Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) and near-zero Recovery Time Objective (RTO) options. The JetStream DR and Ransomware solution implements Continuous Data Protection (CDP) by immediately replicating all data generated by protected VMs. It employs heuristic algorithms to detect data tampering by utilizing cost-effective and high-performance storage options like Azure Blob Storage, Azure NetApp Files (ANF), and ESAN-based solutions. Utilizing the VMware-certified VAIO APIs means that the JetStream solution is fully VMware Ready certified. This approach is unique compared to other market offerings that provide DR protection by creating intermittent snapshots.
 
JetStream has also partnered with Microsoft to develop a unique feature that rehydrates VMs and their data from Azure Blob object storage, deploying them to AVS nodes provisioned on-demand, to a pilot light cluster in AVS. This ensures a rapid and cost-controlled recovery that minimizes downtime in the event of a disaster or ransomware attack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deleting a Job also deletes all Tasks that are part of that Job, and all Job statistics. This also overrides the retention period for Task data; that is, if the Job contains Tasks which are still retained on Compute Nodes, the Batch service deletes those Tasks' working directories and all their contents. When a Delete Job request is received, the Batch service sets the Job to the deleting state. All update operations on a Job that is in deleting state will fail with status code 409 (Conflict), with additional information indicating that the Job is being deleted.
 
We can use below PowerShell command to delete one single job using job id:
 
 
Remove-AzBatchJob -Id "Job-000001" -BatchContext $Context
 
 
But if you have a large number of jobs and wants to delete them simultaneously, then you can refer below PowerShell command for the same:
 
# Replace with your Azure Batch account name, resource group, and subscription ID
$accountName = "yourBatchAccountName"
$resourceGroupName = "yourResourceGroupName"

# Authenticate to Azure
Connect-AzAccount

# Get the Batch account context
$batchContext = Get-AzBatchAccount -Name $accountName -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName

# Get all batch jobs with creation time before May 2024
# Replace the creation time date accordingly

$jobsForDelete = Get-AzBatchJob -BatchContext $batchContext | Where-Object {$_.CreationTime -lt "2024-05-01"}

# List the jobs
Write-Host "Jobs to be deleted:"
foreach ($job in $jobsForDelete) {
    Write-Host $job.Id
    # Write-Host "Deleting jobs..."
    Remove-AzBatchJob -Id $job.Id -BatchContext $batchContext -Force
}


 
 
 
The above script will delete all the jobs created before the creation date. You can accordingly modify the parameters as per your requirement.]]></summary>

The ability to configure multiple IP addresses per cluster load balancer is now generally available.
ARO clusters can now scale up to 250 worker nodes.

Previously, ARO clusters were limited to 62 worker nodes due to having only one IP (Internet Protocol) address associated with the cluster's load balancer. By enabling multiple IP addresses for the load balancer, we have removed this bottleneck, offering organizations greater flexibility in expanding their deployments.

For the workload profile container app, private link support is not yet available. This is because the “Private Link Service does not support a load balancer that has an IP-based backend pool, which is used in Consumption + Dedicated environments (Workload Profile)”. Although we have a roadmap to implement this feature (Private link support for Workload Profiles · Azure Container Apps Roadmap), there is currently no ETA.
 
In the meantime, I will guide you on how to integrate a workload profile container app with Azure Front Door using an Application Gateway. The architecture involves using the Application Gateway private link to connect to the Front Door, and placing the Application Gateway in the same VNET as the container app to achieve this integration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When building HTTP APIs, it can be tempting to synchronously run long-running tasks in a request handler. This approach can lead to slow responses, timeouts, and resource exhaustion. If a request times out or a connection is dropped, the client won't know if the operation completed or not. For CPU-bound tasks, this approach can also bog down the server, making it unresponsive to other requests.
 
In this post, we'll look at how to build an asynchronous HTTP API with Azure Container Apps. We'll create a simple API that implements the Asynchronous Request-Reply pattern: with the API hosted in a container app and the asynchronous processing done in a job. This approach provides a much more robust and scalable solution for long-running tasks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The article discusses a problem where numerous messages end up in the dead letter queue (DLQ) when the JMS service bus consumer connects to the Azure Service Bus using Qpid jars. The reason for the messages being dead-lettered is that they have reached the maximum delivery count.
 
The fundamental issue stems from Apache Qpid's message handling. Qpid utilizes a local buffer to prefetch messages from the Azure Service Bus, storing them prior to delivery to the consumer. The complication occurs when Qpid prefetches an excessive number of messages that the consumer is unable to process within the lock duration. Consequently, the consumer is unable to acknowledge or finalize the processing of these messages before the lock expires, leading to an accumulation of messages in the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).
 
To address this problem, it is crucial to either turn off Qpid's local buffer or modify the prefetch count. Disabling prefetching is achievable by setting jms.prefetchPolicy.all=0 in the JMS client. This configuration allows the JMS client to directly consume messages from the Azure Service Bus, circumventing Qpid's local buffer. Consequently, the consumer can process messages at a suitable pace, guaranteeing smooth processing and issue-free completion.
 
Why is Prefetch not the default option in Microsoft .NET/Java/Python libs?]]></summary>

As a developer, if you’re using the modern experience in SharePoint, the option to upload a SharePoint list template (.stp) file isn’t obvious in your settings. Also, if you try to upload it, you might get a message that says, “Sorry, you don’t have access.”

Starting August 1st, Azure Container Registry (ACR) will update its behavior regarding the deletion and re-creation of registries. ACR will prevent the reuse of a subdomain name, e.g. abc123.azurecr.io, for a period after the resource is deleted. This updated behavior enhances security and prevents subdomain takeovers by automatically reserving registry names during the creation of the ACR resource, without requiring any additional action or configuration from customers. 
 
Once a resource name is reserved, it remains reserved from the moment of creation and throughout an extended period following the deletion of the resource (referred to as a cooldown period). During this cooldown period, subscriptions not associated with the original Azure AD tenant that created the reso…]]></summary>

In our latest video, we explored a real-world application of .NET and AI working together.
 Building a LLM from zero
Bruno and Shaltiel hosted this session where the main focus was to showcase how ASP.NET, ONNX Runtime, and TorchSharp are leveraged to build a robust product that handles over 100,000 requests a day in each server instance.
 
The hosts also talked about the integration of different deep learning architectures like BERT models and RNNs, which are focused to minimize latency and maximize performance.
 
During the session Shaltiel showcased how to train a model from zero using Python libraries and how to later export the model to ONNX format and use it in C#. Bringing the best of both worlds.
 


Make sure to check out the full video for an in-depth look at how you can start leveraging these tools today and propel your projects into the future of AI-driven development.

I decided to give the Node SDK a go just to see how well it works and stumbled upon a great cookbook tutorial by OpenAI. I took most of the code from that sample as-is, wrote a static front-end chat client for it, and then wired it up as a sample space called “Activity Planner Agent” that you can easily deploy in App Spaces.  The only prerequisite is that you’ll need an OpenAI API key, which we’ll walk through below.

What is it
Azure Web Apps or Azure Function Apps frequently communicate with Application Insights to log various levels of data, which can later be reviewed and filtered in the Log Analytics Workspace.
 
Taking Python as an example, the official documentation mentions that the OpenCensus package will no longer be supported after 2024-09-30.

 
 
The article suggests OpenTelemetry as the latest alternative. In response to the growing cybersecurity awareness among many companies, many users have disabled the 'Local Authentication' feature in Application Insights to enhance security.

 
 
Therefore, this article will focus on how Web Apps/Function Apps can use Managed Identity to communicate with Application Insights and utilize the latest OpenTelem…]]></summary>

Azure Site Recovery (ASR) is a service that often comes to mind when adopting a business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) approach. In summary, ASR continuously replicates workloads running on physical and virtual machines (VMs) from a primary to a secondary site. If disaster strikes and causes an outage, ASR will fail over workloads to the secondary site and ensure applications remain accessible, and later fail back to the primary site once it becomes available again. A secondary ‘site’ may be another Azure region, or a different availability zone in the same Azure region.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A memory dump is a snapshot of the contents of a computer's volatile memory (RAM) stored for analysis or debugging purposes.  ProcDump is a command-line tool designed to monitor applications for CPU/Memory spikes and generate crash dumps when spikes occur. Administrators or developers can then use these dumps to pinpoint the cause of the spikes. This guide will walk you through collecting a memory dump using Procdump.exe for applications hosted on App Service (Windows).
 

Access the Azure Portal and navigate to the desired App Service.
Click on "Advanced Tools" and then "Go ->" to access the SCM/Kudu site.


 

On the SCM site, go to Process Explorer to find the PID of the w3wp.exe process, which is the application worker process.


 

Use the Debug console to open the CMD option.


 

Navigate to the System Drive and access the sysinternals path:

C:\devtools\sysinternals>
Note: The drive letter may vary (e.g., D:\ or C:)



 

Locate the procdump.exe file in the sysinternals directory, which will be used for running commands.
To collect logs for the application worker process, use the PID obtained earlier.
Use the following command to collect a full memory dump.

Procdump.exe -accepteula -ma [PID] [Path]

Path: Specifies the directory where the collected memory dump file will be stored.


Example: procdump.exe -accepteula -ma 5100 C:\dumps\



 

Initiate the dump collection and reproduce the issue the application is facing.


 

After the memory dump collection is complete, access the specific path on the SCM site to download the collected memory dump.



 
You can consult the following article for further details on Procdump commands and various parameters to utilize depending on your specific needs and troubleshooting scenario.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump
 
It's advisable to gather multiple sets of memory dumps because analyzing several dumps can reveal patterns and facilitate the development of an action plan to resolve issues effectively.]]></summary>

This article describes how to copy all Azure Storage Tables data between two different storage accounts.
 
For this, we will use Azure Storage SDK for Python to copy all tables (and the respective data) from one Azure Storage Table to another Azure Storage Table. This approach will keep the data in the source tables, and will create new tables with the respective data in the destination Azure Storage Table.
 
This script was developed and tested using the following versions but it is expected to work with previous versions:

Python 3.11.7
azure-data-tables (version: 12.5.0)
azure-core (version: 1.30.1)

 
Approach

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This blog emphasizes the process of gathering profiler traces for application hosted on App Service that is experiencing slowness. It also provides guidance on how to review these collected traces to pinpoint the root cause and take steps towards resolving it.
 

Access the Azure Portal and navigate to the desired App Service.
Navigate to "Diagnose and Solve Problems" -> "Diagnostic Tools"


 

Choose "Collect .NET Profiler Trace" option.
Configure the trace options to gather data from the specific application instance, including thread details.


 

Reproduce the issue at step 2.


 

Access and examine the generated report.


 

In the demo application, a delay of approximately 20 seconds was observed. Refer to the browser network traces provided below.


 

Analyze the profiler traces to pinpoint the cause of the reported delay.


 

After examining the demo app's code, it was evident that a deliberate 20-second delay was introduced in the Privacy method within the Home Controller.


 

Note: Default profiler log collection time is 60 seconds and it is possible to increase the default profiling duration by setting an application setting IIS_PROFILING_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS with a maximum value of 900 (i.e. 15 minutes).]]></summary>

What is RAG?
Before we dive into the demo, let’s quickly recap what RAG is. RAG is a hybrid approach that enhances the capabilities of a language model by incorporating external knowledge. In example: using a RAG approach we can retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base and use them to generate more informed and accurate responses. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a LLM needs up-to-date information or specific domain knowledge that isn't contained within its initial training data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year at BUILD we announced the public preview of the Network Observability add-on. Today we’re excited to share a massive upgrade to the network observability capabilities available to AKS customers. 
 
What’s new?
We are excited to announce Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS), a suite of services built to significantly enhance the operational capabilities of your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. Advanced Network Observability is the inaugural feature of the ACNS suite bringing the power of Hubble’s control plane to both Cilium and Non-Cilium Linux data planes. With Advanced Network Observability, customers can now pinpoint network-related issues with more precision and detect root causes faster.  The offering provides pod level packet statistics, DNS statistics, L4 connections and enhanced debugging capabilities with network flow logs and DNS error tracking.
Data flow for Advanced Network Observability
 
How can Azure customers use the new offering?
ACNS is integrated deeply with existing Azure Monitor capabilities for monitoring AKS clusters. Using the new capabilities requires no extra configuration from customers. Customers can enable advanced network observability with a single command. The metrics are then ingested automatically by Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus. Additionally, customers can visualize the metrics in pre-built dashboards in Azure Managed Grafana. Customers have access to 6 pre-built dashboards in Azure Managed Grafana covering a breadth of signals from cluster traffic to DNS and pod level flows.
 
Pod flows dashboard built into Azure Manged Grafana
 
 
How to get ACNS
To get started with ACNS capabilities, please see our onboarding documentation

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year at BUILD we announced the public preview of the Network Observability add-on. Today we’re excited to share a massive upgrade to the network observability capabilities available to AKS customers. 
 
What’s new?
We are excited to announce Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS), a suite of services built to significantly enhance the operational capabilities of your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. Advanced Network Observability is the inaugural feature of the ACNS suite bringing the power of Hubble’s control plane to both Cilium and Non-Cilium Linux data planes. With Advanced Network Observability, customers can now pinpoint network-related issues with more precision and detect root causes faster.  The offering provides pod level packet statistics, DNS statistics, L4 connections and enhanced debugging capabilities with network flow logs and DNS error tracking.
Data flow for Advanced Network Observability
 
How can Azure customers use the new offering?
ACNS is integrated deeply with existing Azure Monitor capabilities for monitoring AKS clusters. Using the new capabilities requires no extra configuration from customers. Customers can enable advanced network observability with a single command. The metrics are then ingested automatically by Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus. Additionally, customers can visualize the metrics in pre-built dashboards in Azure Managed Grafana. Customers have access to 6 pre-built dashboards in Azure Managed Grafana covering a breadth of signals from cluster traffic to DNS and pod level flows.
 
Pod flows dashboard built into Azure Manged Grafana
 
 
How to get ACNS
To get started with ACNS capabilities, please see our onboarding documentation

Believe it or not, not all data is meant for analytics. Sometimes reporting requirements include flat data that is not inherently dimensional. This often includes querying large tables with low cardinality columns. Think of:

Audit trails – understanding who accessed what at a certain point in time or what events occurred when
Financial transaction data – querying financial transactions by invoice id
Web analytics – identifying which pages were accessed at what date, time and location

This type of data can have millions or billions of rows to sift through.
 
So where does this type of reporting fit into your reporting environment? In Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse and Power BI Report Developer paginated reports!

RAG uses information from additional sources to enhance the output of a large language model (LLM).  If you’ve used LLMs like ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot, you’ve probably gotten your fair share of hallucinations, responses that are wrong, often to the point of silliness. In fact, Microsoft Copilot comes with a warning: “Copilot uses AI. Check for mistakes.” RAG grounds the responses in authoritative external knowledge making them more accurate and useful.

My name is Suzaril Shah and I am a Gold Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador and a Microsoft Certified Trainer from Malaysia.
 
I am excited to share my two favorite image analysis solutions to protect images hosted on Azure Container Registry. Please note that it is not my intention to compare these two solutions because I love working with both Microsoft Defender for Containers and Docker Scout altogether and they complement each other. If anything, they should be used alongside each other to further enhance container security on ACR.

You can easily create, configure, and execute load tests using JMeter scripts or custom code, and monitor the results in real-time on the Azure portal. You can also integrate your load tests with your CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps or GitHub actions.
Until now, you could only view the load test results on the Azure portal, which required internet access and RBAC permissions. Now, you can download the report as an HTML file and share it with your stakeholders or teammates offline. The HTML report contains the same charts and metrics as the online report, but in a portable and convenient format.

In our latest video, we went into the fascinating world of Redis and its integration with AI, specifically focusing on how it can enhance .NET applications.
 
Redis and .NET
 
Bruno, Katherine, and Stanley shared their insights on leveraging Redis for building intelligent, high-performance applications. They showcased two compelling demo applications:
 

A .NET Contoso HR web application augmented with AI and Redis for chatbot-style capabilities.
An eShop web application enhanced with AI for intelligent recommendations and improved performance.

The discussion also touched upon key concepts such as large language models, vector similarity search, and retrieval augmented generative AI, providing a comprehensive overview of the technical landscape. The integration of Redis with Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise was particularly emphasized, showcasing its ability to support vector similarity search and offer low latency, which is crucial for real-time applications.
 
This session was a testament to the power of combining Redis with AI to create more dynamic, responsive, and intelligent applications.

Large Language Models were trained by data from all over the internet with billions of parameters. To generate an output from LLMs, you need a prompt. For day-to-day questions for example generating a LinkedIn Post from a blog post, you may need additional instructions for your LLM, for example: the word count, tone of the message, the format and the call to action at the end. Using prompty, you can easily standardize your prompt and execute it into a single asset.


Why Prompty.

AI is all about probability, and the probability of it being incorrect, or behaving unexpectedly for a new input is practically never zero.

Or have you already built a web app with Python, but wondered how you can deploy it online? If so, you might be interested in watching this video by and Pamela Fox and Renee Noble, two Python Cloud Advocates at Microsoft with a passion for web development and education!
 
They’ll show you how to create a web app with Python Flask (or it’s async-sibling Quart) and show you how you can deploy you can take your web app live by deploying it on Azure. This is the first episode in this live stream series (which you can also catch on demand!) by Pamela and friends covering different web dev frameworks and practices! (And you can catch it in Spanish too!)



 
In this video, you will learn how the web works and why you (likely) need a web server to serve up your web app. You will also discover how a backend web framework, like Flask, helps you develop your web server quickly and easily and how it lets you use templates to build dynamic sites - whether it’s your first site or a complex full-scale service.
 
Want to improve your web server throughput? Find out how you can port your app to Quart, the asynchronous version of Flask. And of course, you’ll see how you can deploy your web apps to Azure App Service in minutes and learn what other deployment options you might be interested in seeking out depending on your project.
 
The video is perfect for beginners who have some familiarity with Python, but no prior experience with web development or deployment. It is also suitable for intermediate or advanced developers who want to refresh their skills or learn new tricks. Take a look at the video to learn some concepts and follow along with our coding and deployment demos! You can grab the demo repo here and check out the slides too.]]></summary>
