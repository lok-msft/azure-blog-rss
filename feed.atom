What are vector databases?
Eric defines vector databases as a way in which we store meaningful information about multi-dimensional aspects of data such as what's called vectors, which are numerical, typically numerical integers which work very much like a traditional relational database system.
 
What's interesting about the vector databases is that they help us solve different types of queries. One type of query is like a “nearest neighbor”.

How do you manage the lifecycle of those APIs?
What governance would you apply to these APIs?
What is the list of environments needed to manage these APIs?
What are the deployment strategies for those APIs?
How would you integrate those APIs with other services?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the previous series of articles, we learned about the basic concepts of AI agents and how to use AutoGen or Semantic Kernel combined with the Azure OpenAI Service Assistant API to build AI agent applications. For different scenarios and workflows, powerful tools need to be assembled to support the operation of the AI agent. If you only use your own tool chain in the AI agent framework to solve enterprise workflow, it will be very limited. AutoGen supports defining tool chains through Function Calling, and developers can define different methods to assemble extended business work chains. As mentioned before, Semantic Kernel has good business-based plug-in creation, management and engineering capabilities. Through AutoGen + Semantic Kernel, powerful AI agent solutions can be built.

A global enterprise wants to migrate thousands of Nutanix AHV or VMware vSphere virtual machines (VMs) to Microsoft Azure as part of their application modernization strategy. The first step is to exit their on-premises data centers and rapidly relocate their legacy application VMs to the Nutanix Cloud Clusters on Azure (NC2 on Azure) service as a staging area for the first phase of their modernization strategy. How can they quickly size NC2 on Azure to meet their workload requirements?

It’s time to go back to AI and NET, so today’s post is a small demo on how to run a LLM (large language model, this demo using Phi-2) in local mode, and how to interact with the model using Semantic Kernel.
 
LM Studio
I’ve tested several products and libraries to run LLMs locally, and LM Studio is on my top 3. LM Studio is a desktop application that allows you to run open-source models locally on your computer. You can use LM Studio to discover, download, and chat with models from Hugging Face, or create your own custom models. LM Studio also lets you run a local inference server that mimics the OpenAI API, so you can use any model with your favourite tools and frameworks. LM Studio is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux, and you can download it from their website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the impending retirement of the classic Cloud Service (CS) on August 31st, 2024, an increasing number of users have initiated the migration of their classic Cloud Service to Cloud Service Extended Support (CSES). To facilitate this transition, an official feature known as in-place migration has been introduced, enabling the seamless migration of classic CS to CSES without incurring any downtime. However, certain limitations exist, with the VM size used by the CS role being a notable factor. As per documentation, the A-series, encompassing Small, Medium, and Large VM sizes, is no longer supported in CSES, necessitating their conversion to corresponding VM sizes as a preliminary step.

Our systems can sometimes be a black box. We toss a request into it and get something back, but what goes on inside? Cutting through the tech jargon, observability is a measure of how well we understand the system from the outside looking in.
 
You might wonder, isn’t that monitoring? Well, not quite. Monitoring tells you when something is wrong, like if your CPU is overloaded or if there’s a glitch slowing things down (that’s the “What”). Observability, on the other hand, is like being a detective. It helps you understand the story behind the problem (the “Why”).
 
Let’s say an app is responding slowly. We might have all these cool charts and graphs showing us the problem, but do they tell us why it’s happening? Not always.

To start, with the Lifecycle management, you will be mainly transitioning blobs from one tier to another or delete the blobs based on the specified rule configuration. So, either Set Blob Tier (REST API) - Azure Storage | Microsoft Learn or Delete Blob (REST API) - Azure Storage | Microsoft Learn will be called underneath respectively. 
 
Now, the policy executes as part of backend scheduling and so the exact timings as to when the policy be executing on a particular day isn’t available directly. However, the policy will run once a day, and we can check for these metrics specifically. We will do this via a 2-step method.

In this episode, we host Muna Numan and Syntiche Musawu, co-founders of Tawi, an app that uses speech recognition technology to suppress background noise, enhance speech quality and transcribe speech all in real-time for children living with Auditory Processing Disorder (APD). With just earphones and a mobile phone, children with APD overcome a huge communication barrier, comfortably interacting with their peers and navigating the world with more confidence to achieve their full potential.
 
Team TAWI also emerged as the Microsoft Imagine Cup 2023 World Champions, and in this episode, they talk about:

The ins and outs of their product (including the architecture under the hood)
AI technologies that power the product – Azure AI Service (Speech service) and OpenAI’s Whisper (now available on Microsoft Azure)
Challenges, including conflicts during the team formation stage and how they resolved this to achieve their mission.
A one-stop shop for all founders, Microsoft Founders Hub, that provided the cloud infrastructure they needed to build their product, at no cost.

Azure Stack HCI 23H2 introduces a new method for deploying the cluster from the Azure portal. You use the Azure portal to join on-premises servers to the domain, build a cluster, and set up an AKS on top of that to act as the resource bridge created by an AKS Cluster. These involve numerous steps and tasks that need completion, spanning from the cloud to your on-premises servers. In this blog, I will share the most common steps to help you avoid any issues that could lead to your cluster failing in the middle of the deployment.OS Installation 
If you are using existing hardware with a previous version of HCI, the wizard will prompt you to choose between a new installation or an upgrade. Opt for a new installation, but ensure to clean all the disks. This involves deleting all …]]></summary>

When we started off one year ago, the goal was to empower students, developers, founders, professionals and everyone on the planet with the opportunity to learn about open-source tools that can redefine the way they build solutions. For many, Open at Microsoft was just more than a show.

These models can generate natural language, images, code, and other types of content based on your inputs and parameters. However, to use these models effectively, you need to consider the quotas and limits that apply to your Azure OpenAI resources, such as tokens per minute, requests per minute, and provisioned throughput units. You also need to handle the possible failures and errors that might occur when calling these models, such as network issues, timeouts, or service unavailability.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[En los últimos seis meses, hemos conocido a cientos de desarrolladores que están utilizando Python para crear aplicaciones de chat de IA en sus propios campos de conocimiento, utilizando RAG (Recuperación Aumentada de Generación) para enviar fragmentos de información a un modelo de LLM junto con la pregunta del usuario.
 


 

También hemos escuchado a muchos desarrolladores que les gustaría aprender a crear sus propias aplicaciones de chat con RAG, pero no saben por dónde empezar. Por eso, estamos organizando un hackathon virtual para ayudarte a aprender a construir tu propia aplicación de chat con RAG en Python.

 

 

Del 29 de enero al 12 de febrero, realizaremos transmisiones en vivo en inglés y los días 31 de enero y 2 de febrero en español, donde te mostraremos cómo construir en nuestro repositorio de ejemplo de chat con RAG más popular, al mismo tiempo que explicamos los conceptos clave detrás de todas las aplicaciones de chat con RAG modernas. Los temas de las transmisiones en vivo incluirán búsqueda vectorial, control de acceso, GPT-4 con visión y más.
 
Mantente conectado a tus sesiones locales de Reactor. Esperamos involucrar a desarrolladores de todo el mundo, así que también tendremos transmisiones en vivo en español, portugués y chino. Habrá premios para las mejores aplicaciones e incluso un premio para el miembro más útil de la comunidad. ¡Mantente atento a tus sesiones locales de Reactor!
 
Para obtener más información, visita la página de Reactor para sintonizar tu evento local y visita la página AI Chat App Hack, donde podrás seguir los pasos para registrarte y unirte a la comunidad. ¡Te esperamos ya!

Recently, I've been building an app using .NET Aspire which I'm using PostgreSQL as the database and Azure Storage Blobs and Queues in.
.NET Aspire is awesome for this, as you can setup a developer inner loop super simply with the components that ship, and the nice thing about this is that locally PostgreSQL is run in a Docker container and Azure Storage uses the Azurite storage emulator (which also happens to run in a container).
The problem with this is that when you restart your app, you lose all the data in the database and storage emulator, since they are started fresh each time.

You can also use JMeter backend listeners to write the results to a data store of your choice and analyze the data.
When you use the download results option, the ALT service splits the results into one CSV file per engine. This ensures that the file size is not huge, and it is easy to open the files in tools like notepad, excel to analyze the data. In cases where your input data is split across test engines, you can pick the results file for a specific engine and analyze.

        <updated>2024-01-22T07:31:43.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure App Service supports HTTP 2.0. The major advance of HTTP/1.1 was the use of persistent connections to service multiple requests in a row. In HTTP/2, a persistent connection can be used to service multiple simultaneous requests. 
 
This blog will demonstrate how you can send HTTP 2.0 Request to app service for testing using C#:
 
Step 1:
Go to > App Service > Configuration > Enable HTTP 2.0

 
Step 2:
Create a .Net Core Console Application / Web Application as per requirement . In this example I have taken a .Net Core Console Application:
 
 
var client = new HttpClient() { BaseAddress = new Uri("https://<>.azurewebsites.net") };

            Console.WriteLine("Sending HTTP 2.0 Request.");

            // HTTP/2 request
            using (var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, "/") { Version = new Version(2, 0) })
            using (var response = await client.SendAsync(request))
                Console.WriteLine(response);


 
 
The HTTPClient class has DefaultRequestVersion property with which you can set the default version of the requests as below:
 
 
var SecondRequest = new HttpClient()
            {
                BaseAddress = new Uri("https://<>.azurewebsites.net"),
                DefaultRequestVersion = new Version(2, 0)
            };

            // HTTP/2 is default
            using (var response = await SecondRequest.GetAsync("/"))
                Console.WriteLine(response);
 
 
You should be able to see a successful HTTP Response once the code executes:
 

 
For more information you can refer the below documents:

Azure Monitor is an amazing suite of technologies that lets you collect, visualize, and act on data from your Azure resources. You can use metrics and logs to monitor the health and performance of any Azure resource. Microsoft offers tailored experiences for specific workloads, such as Virtual Machine Insights. Some of these experiences also include alerts and modern dashboards (Grafana) to help you act and troubleshoot issues. However, for server-based workloads, such as IIS, Print Servers, DNS, and others, there was no native cloud solution for monitoring. Until now.

Recently, customers have been implementing RAG patterns to construct the generative AI application. I will provide a detailed guide on how to enable authentication for a Gen AI web app, which signs in users using Entra ID, and how to restrict access to web pages based on Entra ID security groups. Furthermore, I will discuss how to implement access control when searching documents on Azure AI Search, using the security group as a filter. This pattern can similarly be applied to other metadata elements, like user ID, for enhanced security and personalized information retrieval.

Many service providers, including OpenAI, usually set limits on the number of calls that can be made. In the case of Azure OpenAI, there are token limits (TPM or tokens per minute) and limits on the number of requests per minute (RPM). When a server starts running out of resources or the service limits are exhausted, the provider may issue a 429 or TooManyRequests HTTP Status code, and also a Retry-After response header indicating how much time you should wait until you try the next request.

When it comes to website security, one important step is to add a custom domain and connect it with a TLS/SSL certificate. This not only enhances the trust and safety of your website but also ensures that your visitors' information is encrypted and protected. Azure App Service provides TLS bindings for the most common custom domains. This blog discusses the special domain and certificate binding situations in Azure App Service for IDN hostnames.

What is an IDN hostname?
An IDN hostname is a domain name that includes characters used in the local representation of languages not written with the basic Latin alphabet "a-z". These characters can be Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Cyrillic, Tamil, Hindi, and more.

Organisations are increasingly understanding the value that machine learning and artificial intelligence can deliver across all industries. Subsequently those organisations are also evaluating how to move machine learning projects from experimental stages to production. This surge in AI/ML interest also comes at a time when businesses are prioritising cost optimization of new and existing technology projects.
 
Frequently customers I am speaking too are asking how they can deploy reliable, robust and cost effective deployment platforms for moving machine learning models into production. Customers using Azure to deploy CPU based ML models have a few different options, batch endpoints on Azure Machine Learning, AKS for those familiar with running enterprise Kubernetes and Azur…]]></summary>

You can use either a system-assigned managed identity that is created by the policy service or a user-assigned identity provided by the user.
 
Each Azure Policy assignment can be associated with only one managed identity and, after adding a managed identity to policy assignment, it is possible to edit only some managed identity related settings of the policy assignment.

Crafting Effective Prompts
One of the key aspects of working with large language models is the ability to craft effective prompts. These prompts need to be suitably constrained to elicit useful responses. For instance, an architect might want to ask for a solution architecture perspective response that meets specific functional and non-functional requirements.

All Azure Spring Apps regions under the Enterprise plan are eligible for substantial cost savings – 20% for one year and 47% for three years – when you commit to Azure savings Plan.
 
Committing to the savings plan allows you to get savings, up to the hourly commitment amount, on the resources you use. You can choose to pay all at once or monthly. The best part? Turning on the Savings Plan will not mess with your current set-ups or apps. You just get the savings while everything runs as usual. If you are running big apps, this plan can optimize your investments. It brings down your overall costs for using Azure Spring Apps Enterprise.

Migrating a full-stack application can be an intricate job, even if you are using the same technologies on different clouds. Some things need to be done in order to have a fully functional application. If both platforms support the programming language and version, then that's one thing to put aside and start working on figuring out how to connect the database. Databases differ in the language they speak. You can use a universal dialect like SQLAlchemy that facilitates communication with multiple databases like MySQL. The last problem is to provide the application with the credentials it needs in a way it understands to establish a connection. Once you are done and the database is up and running. Here, comes the part where you look for a tool to import your data. Luckily, mysq…]]></summary>

But for some scenarios, user does not really want to fully block the traffic from public Internet, but just wants to make the CSES safer. In this scenario, adding an Azure Application Gateway in front of CSES will be a good idea. It can provide following benefits:

From public Internet, the traffic is only able to reach CSES through Application Gateway
From Virtual Network, the traffic is not blocked by this design
User can add additional feature such as Web Application Firewall to make the traffic safer

This article will provide a demonstration on how to utilize either SAS token authentication or managed identity from API Management to make requests to Azure Storage. Furthermore, it will explore and compare the differences between these two options.
 
Comparision
The choice between Managed Identity and SAS Token depends on factors such as the level of control required, the duration of access, and the specific security requirements of your application. Both options offer different levels of access control and security features for accessing Azure Storage.

In today’s azure world, it is always better to do automations rather than do a Manual work. It becomes a headache for all of us to navigate to Azure Portal 
 
Here is the simple way to disable Public Network access by using PowerShell script.
 
Solution:
 
 
Connect-AzAccount
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId "<Sub ID>"
$accessToken = $(Get-AzAccessToken).Token
$body = '{"location": "xxxxxx","properties": {"publicNetworkAccess": "Disabled","defaultAction": "Deny","virtualNetworkRules": [],"ipRules": []}}' | ConvertTo-Json
$obj = ConvertFrom-Json -InputObject $body
$uri = 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<Sub ID>/resourceGroups/<RG>/providers/Microsoft.Relay/namespaces/<NS>/networkrulesets/default?api-version=2021-11-01'
Invoke-RestMethod -Method PUT -Uri $uri -Headers @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer $accessToken" } -Body $obj -ContentType "application/json"

 
 
 
Please find below steps on how to run the PowerShell script to disable Public Network access for Azure Relay. 
 
Step 1: Login to Azure portal
 
Step 2: Open Azure PowerShell terminal and connect to your Azure account using any of options mentioned in Authentication Methods
 
Step 3: Just add the Resource Group name and Subscription Id and Relay namespace.
 
Step 4: Run the above commands to enable Public Network access for Azure Relay

Addressing the challenges of building AI solutions with high-volume token usage, explore strategic recommendations for overcoming token limits, optimizing model deployments, and practical techniques for maximizing token usage with Azure OpenAI.
 
Key Challenges
 
Reaching maximum token limits in Azure OpenAI
The available models for Azure OpenAI Service, including GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4, have hard maximum token limits per request. These ensure the models operate efficiently and produce relevant, cohesive responses. While token limits increase with newer models, token limits still require ISVs and Digital Natives to explore alternative approaches to overcome them for their project needs.

GitHub Classroom allows educators to create unit tests to automatically score students’ programming tasks. However, the pre-condition for running unit tests is that the project codes must be runnable or compile without error. Therefore, if students cannot keep the project fully runnable, they will only receive a zero mark. This is undesirable, especially in the programming practical test situation. Even if students submit partially correct code statements, they should earn some scores. As a result, educator will need to review all source codes one by one. This task is very exhausting, time-consuming, and hard to grade in a fair and consistent manner.

Many service providers, including OpenAI usually set limits on the number of calls that can be made. In the case of Azure OpenAI, there are token limits (TPM or tokens per minute) and limits on the number of requests per minute (RPM). When a server starts running out of resources or the service limits are exhausted, the provider may issue a 429 or TooManyRequests HTTP Status code, and also a Retry-After response header indicating how much time you should wait until you try the next request.

Azure Container Apps is a great platform for running polyglot apps and containers of all kinds in Azure, as it abstracts away the complexity of managing underlying Kubernetes while providing unified networking, observability, and scaling for higher developer velocity. While it serves as a versatile container platform, it may not offer precise insights into your Java applications or the state of your Java execution environment (such as the JVM). To better cater to our Java-centric customers running containerized apps, we've recently initiated a new journey to enhance the Java developer experience on Azure Container Apps.

Logs are constantly recording what is going on in a machine. Logs can provide help in tracking security related events, can be used for auditing, troubleshooting and more. In Windows, logs that are saved contain information about applications and the operating system itself. Moreover, these logs are structured and human-readable. For viewing the logs, Windows uses its Windows Event Viewer.
 

 
There are five main categories under Windows logs:

System - Logs created by the operating system.
Application- Logged by an application hosted locally.
Setup - Logs created in the process of installing or changing the Windows installation.
Security - Logs related to logins, privileges, and other similar events.
Forwarded Events - Events forwarded by other computers.

What are Cloud-Native Apps?
Cloud-native apps represent a modern approach to app development, designed with cloud technologies in mind. Unlike apps designed to run on premises, cloud-native apps can fully leverage the many services Azure offers. Many cloud architects opt for Open-Source Software (OSS) like Kubernetes and Docker when designing cloud-native apps, but turn to proprietary offerings like Cosmos DB when the benefit is overwhelming. This makes the end-to-end process of building an application easier, focusing on architectural modularity, rather than m…]]></summary>

Please note that SFTP feature support is only available for hierarchical namespace (ADLS Gen2) enabled accounts.
In this article, we will discuss about how to troubleshoot and isolate connectivity issues to SFTP storage account from your machine to understand whether this is due to port blockage, firewall issues, connectivity using private endpoint, incompatibility of the client being used due to unsupported algorithms whether from Windows or Linux machine.

Socket.IO library is natively supported on Azure. Since we public previewed this feature, we received positive feedback from users. Now we are happy to share that Web PubSub for Socket.IO is generally available, which means that Azure customers can expect stable APIs, SLAs customer support and it’s suitable for use in production.
 
Solve the scalability issue without code rewrite.
When we interviewed Socket.IO users, the challenge of scaling out Socket.IO servers came up repeatedly. It’s a challenge that can be met uniquely by Azure. With the input from Socket.IO users, it’s a challenge we aimed to solve when we public previewed the support for Socket.IO on Azure two months ago.

This set of tools is:

GitHub Templates

Inspiration
The genesis of our AI language learning product is quite a story — It all started during a discussion about the lack of customizable learning tools for reading practice. My friend Fan (Benjamin) Wang, who is an Online Course Designer & Technical Writer at Shanbay China, then shared his ideas of how to create one with Azure API, and we thought it would be worthwhile to turn the prototype into a product. So I formed the team with Yanxin (Jeff) Luo(Embedded Software Engineer), Yankun (Alex) Meng(Duke CS & ECE), and Vivian Yang(Duke Fuqua Quantitative Management) in Duke Generative AI Hackathon to make it happen. Our innovative approach and dedication culminated in a significant achievement: “TalkwithMe” was honored as…]]></summary>

When you create a Kubernetes cluster using the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you can choose between three “outbound” types to suit your application’s specific needs. However, by default with each outbound type, you will end up with a single egress “device” and a single egress IP address for your whole cluster. 
 
Problem Statement
 
In some situations, generally in multi-tenancy clusters, you may need more than one egress IP address for your applications. You might have downstream customers that your applications need to connect to, and those customers want to whitelist your IP address. Or maybe you need to connect to a database in another virtual network or a third party resource like an API, and they want to whitelist the IP address you can connect from. Either way, you …]]></summary>

.NET MAUI is a framework for developing cross-platform mobile and desktop applications which offers native performance and user experience. Write once, run everywhere: your app can be deployed to Android, Windows, iOS, and macOS without any change in the code! However, for a long time, you could only create .NET MAUI apps using Visual Studio, thus you needed either Windows or macOS to develop this kind of cross-platform application. 

 
In July this year, the first preview of the .NET MAUI extension for Visual Studio Code was announced [1], which opened the door to a long-awaited request from developers for the first time: to be able to create .NET MAUI apps on Linux. You can now develop and debug a .NET MAUI app on devices and emulators anywhere VS Code runs… for instance, Ub…]]></summary>

Microsoft is happy to announce the public preview of Kafka Compression for Apache Kafka on Azure Event Hubs.  Kafka Compression enables message producers to transmit compressed data which is decompressed by the consumer.  By compressing your payload, you are able to save a lot of bandwidth and reduce the memory overhead on the brokers supporting your traffic. 
Kafka producer application developers can enable message compression by setting the compression.type property.  
Compression.type = none | gzip 
 
These changes are exposed in the header which then allows the consumer to properly decompress the data.  
 
The feature is currently only supported for Apache Kafka traffic and not AMQP or web service.  
 
There is more information on this feature in documentation at https://aka.ms/kafkacompression]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-11-15T18:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today we are excited to announce General Availability of our partitioned namespaces feature, which allows the use of partitioning for the premium messaging tier. This means that the overall throughput of a partitioned entity is no longer limited by the performance of a single message broker.
 
Moreover, along with the partitioned namespaces feature we are also announcing an updated SLA. If you create a Premium namespace with the new partitioned entities feature enabled, in a region where Availability Zones is available, we will provide an SLA of 99.99%.
 
Partitioned namespaces work in close conjunction with scaling through Messaging Units, as the configured MUs on a namespace are equally distributed across the different partitions. Currently it is possible to scale up to 4 partitions, and as each partition can scale from 1MU to 16MU, this means we can scale up to a total of 64MU.
 
There are some differences between partitioning in the standard and premium SKUs. First, the number of partitions is configured during namespace creation on the premium SKU, while partitioned namespaces in the standard SKU comes with a fixed number of partitions. Second, unlike the standard SKU, partitioned namespaces in the premium SKU do not allow non-partitioned entities in them.
 
To enable partitions, select to enable partitioning and set the number of partitions during creation of a new namespace. Please note that it is not possible to change the number of partitions after creation. More details can be found in the documentation, including a list of regions that are currently supported.]]></summary>

Essential SKU
We’ve observed that many current users of Managed Grafana exclusively or primarily view data from Azure Monitor services, including the managed service for Prometheus. These users don’t require the full extensibility Grafana provides. We’re introducing a simplified Managed Grafana SKU called Essential that focuses on Azure Monitor dashboarding. Because it consumes less resources, the Essential SKU is more cost-effective than the Standard SKU for development and testing uses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you are a student developer or an entrepreneur who wants to build applications using Azure, you might be wondering how to choose the best Azure region for your needs. Azure regions are geographically distributed locations where Azure services are available. Choosing the right region can affect the performance, cost, and availability of your applications.
 
One way to compare Azure regions is to use Azure Speed Test and Azure Latency Test. These are web-based tools that allow you to measure the network speed and latency between your browser and various Azure regions. You can use these tools to find out which regions have the fastest and most reliable connections for your target audience.Azure Speed Test

 
Azure Speed Test measures the upload and download speed between your browser and Azure Blob Storage in each region. Azure Blob Storage is a service that provides scalable and secure cloud storage for your data. You can use Azure Speed Test to see how fast you can upload and download files to and from Azure Blob Storage in different regions.
Azure Latency Test

 
Azure Latency Test measures the round-trip time (RTT) between your browser and Azure App Service in each region. Azure App Service is a service that allows you to easily build, deploy, and manage web and mobile applications on Azure. You can use Azure Latency Test to see how responsive your applications will be in different regions.
By using these tools, you can get a better idea of how Azure regions compare in terms of speed and latency. You can also use these tools to test your applications in different regions and see how they perform. This can help you optimize your applications for your target audience and choose the best Azure region for your needs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, at Ignite we are happy to announce the General availability of Syslog collection from AKS nodes using Container Insights. Since our private preview announcement in March, hundreds of customers have enabled syslog collection on thousands of AKS clusters. We thank you for trying out the preview and providing feedback.
 
IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to slower rollouts towards the year end, the agent version with the GA changes will not be in all regions until January 2024.  Agent versions 3.1.16 and above have Syslog GA changes. Please check agent version before enabling in production.
 
Syslog enables customers to collect logs from Linux-based Kubernetes hosts. This enables customers to monitor kernel issues, troubleshoot host performance, and check for security events. Customers can use syslog with signals in Azure Monitor to perform improved troubleshooting. Additionally, syslog data can be sent to Microsoft Sentinel for security monitoring. 
 

 
With this GA release of Syslog collection, Container Insights customer have a comprehensive Syslog experience:

Enable Syslog collection on AKS clusters

With one-click from the Portal
At scale using commands line tools: Azure CLI, ARM templates, Bicep, Terraform


View Syslog events

using the built-in Azure Workbook
using the out of box dashboard in Azure managed Grafana 


Dive deeper using Syslog queries in Log Analytics   
Send data to Microsoft Sentinel for security monitoring

 Read more about these capabilities in our documentation here: https://aka.ms/CISyslog

Some models use a dedicated Azure OpenAI Service resource per tenant, while others rely on a multitenant application sharing one or more Azure OpenAI Service resources across multiple tenants.

In this post, I want to share a solution to have a portable, self-healing, disposable, disconnected database that doesn't require any installation.
 
The solution? Put the database in a container! It doesn't matter what database you are planning to use or on which OS you are developing.

This not only increases the development workload but also gives rise to maintenance and security challenges. However, the introduction of a gateway concept provides an innovative solution to these issues.
VMware Spring Cloud Gateway, acting as the first line of defense for all incoming requests, assumes the crucial responsibility of handling identity authentication, verifying user identities, and validating their permissions. This means that each microservice no longer needs to code authentication and authorization independently, thus reducing the development workload significantly.

If you are working with many App Service plans, managing the subnets can be an unnecessary administrative task.

MPSJ reduces subnet sprawl when dealing with many apps across many plans and simplifies management of networking control such as Network Security Groups and Route tables across App Service plans. With MPSJ you can join a virtual network/subnet in a different subscription, but all App Service plan joining a specific subnet must be in the same subscription.

Microsoft Reactor’s Make Azure AI Real series is a collection of AI livestreams that are focused on AI technical content from experts at Microsoft. It’s designed for you to learn how to use Microsoft AI tools and services, such as Azure Cognitive Services, Azure OpenAI Service, and more. You will also get insights into the latest AI trends and best practices from Microsoft AI experts. Join us for this exciting series and discover how to make AI real for your projects and goals.
 
About the session:
You might have heard a lot about the advancements of generative AI in the natural language processing (NLP) domain and how large language models reached human parity in a few NLP tasks like question and answering. However, generative AI also heavily enhanced computer vision, enabling models that perform image captioning, editing, retrieval and even generation with the highest accuracy we’ve ever seen.
In this session we cover how Azure AI vision is empowered by large foundation models and what you can do with it. We also look at the real-world use case of a startup founder looking to address food wasting with AI, by exploring several visual features on Azure AI Vision Studio and customizing a pre-trained object detector model with enterprise data.
 
Session material:
You can follow along the presentation and the demo with this Learn Module. Below the on-demand session recording:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In August and September of 2023, I published two blogs in this Tech Community about Metadata Driven Pipelines in Fabric, Metadata Driven Pipelines for Microsoft Fabric and Metadata Driven Pipelines for Microsoft Fabric Part 2, Data Warehouse Style. The response from the community has been amazing and I have received numerous requests for the source code so people can deploy within their own Fabric tenants. The difficulty is that Git support for Fabric at this time is limited, and there are no ARM templates to deploy in like there is in Azure.
 
To meet these requests, I have created step-by-step instructions for these 2 patterns in our Analytics in a Box GitHub Repo. While you will be able to upload the Spark Notebooks as well as upload and run the SQL scripts used in this solution, you will follow the instructions for creating the pipelines and pipeline activities. I have tried to facilitate this by providing you with all the configurations for each pipeline and activity that you can cut and paste into each pipeline or activity setting. While this may be a bit of a laborious effort, I believe you will actually learn more about building Metadata Driven Fabric Pipelines then if you truly could just deploy from out of the box.
 
If you're not quite ready for SaaS for your data analytics, check out the available patterns for Synapse in the same GitHub repo!]]></summary>

        <updated>2023-10-30T03:39:56.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to share that built-in Azure Monitor alerts for Azure Site Recovery is now in public preview.
 
With this integration, Azure Site Recovery users will now have:

A way to route notifications for alerts to any of the destinations supported by Azure Monitor - which includes email, ITSM, Webhook, Functions etc.
An alerting experience for Azure Site Recovery which is consistent with the alerting experience currently available for many other Azure resource types.
Enhanced flexibility in terms of choosing which scenarios to get notified for, ability to suppress notifications during planned maintenance windows, and so on.


 
Once you opt-in to this feature, Azure Site Recovery will start sending default alerts (surfaced via Azure Monitor) whenever any of the following critical events occur:

Enable disaster recovery failure alerts for Azure VM, Hyper-V, and VMware replication.
Replication health critical alerts for Azure VM, Hyper-V, and VMware replication.
Azure Site Recovery agent version expiry alerts for Azure VM and Hyper-V replication.
Azure Site Recovery agent not reachable alerts for Hyper-V replication.
Failover failure alerts for Azure VM, Hyper-V, and VMware replication.
Auto certification expiry alerts for Azure VM replication.

To test the working of the alerts for a test VM using Azure Site Recovery, you can disable public network access for the cache storage account so that a 'Replication Health turned to critical' alert is generated. Alerts are generated by default, without any need for rule configuration. However, to enable notifications (for example, email notifications) for these generated alerts, you must create an alert processing rule.
 
Follow the documentation to get started and refer to the FAQ for answers to common questions.
 
In case of any questions on the feature roadmap, please write to AskAzureBCDR@microsoft.com and we would be happy to understand your scenario in more detail.]]></summary>

In this example, we will walk through the process of creating a Container App with an image reference from the ACR, which automatically generates a secret. We will then attempt to remove this secret and observe its behaviour throughout the process.

Before you stream logs in real-time, enable the log type that you want. Any information written to the console output or files ending in .txt, .log, or .htm that are stored in the /home/LogFiles directory (D:\home\LogFiles) is streamed by App Service.
 
Note: Some types of logging buffer write to the log file, which can result in out of order events in the stream. For example, an application log entry that occurs when a user visits a page may be displayed in the stream before the corresponding HTTP log entry for the page request.
