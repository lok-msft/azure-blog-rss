        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure API Management is a service that helps developers to expose their APIs to different consumers in a secure and scalable way. It allows developers to create, publish, and manage APIs, as well as to apply policies, transformations, and analytics to them. With the hosted APIs becoming super critical to the daily operations of any organization, it is important to ensure the availability of the infrastructure for continued operations. Though the service provides inbuilt resiliency features like Availability Zones and Locations, it is required to be prepared to create a replica of your API Management instance for various reasons, such as disaster recovery, testing, or migration. In this blog post, I will show you how to copy the data from one API Management instance to another, including th…]]></summary>

Server migrations to Azure Virtual Machines either through Azure Migrate or via a redeploy approach can benefit from Azure policies to accelerate adoption of Azure first party services across BCDR, Security, Monitoring and Management. 
 
Our Cloud Adoption Framework’s guidance for Azure Landing Zones already provides a good baseline of recommended Azure policies. However, a variation to this baseline is described in this article with a focus on newly migrated Azure Virtual Machine resources.  
 
BCDR: 
To enable Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery for Virtual Machines, a recovery services vault is needed.

If you are working with many App Service plans, managing the subnets can be an unnecessary administrative task. Therefore, I am happy to announce that we are introducing Multi-plan subnet join (MPSJ) in limited public preview at Ignite 2023.
 
MPSJ reduces subnet sprawl when dealing with many apps across many plans and simplifies management of networking control such as Network Security Groups and Route tables across App Service plans. With MPSJ you can join a virtual network/subnet in a different subscription, but all App Service plan joining a specific subnet must be in the same subscription.

This tutorial outlines a graceful process for developing and deploying a Linux Docker container on your Windows PC, making it easy to deploy to Azure resources.
 
This tutorial emphasizes using the user interface to complete most of the steps, making the process more reliable and understandable. While there are a few steps that require the use of command lines, the majority of tasks can be completed using the UI. This focus on the UI is what makes the process graceful and user-friendly.
 
In this tutorial, we will use a Python Flask application as an example, but the steps should be similar for other languages such as Node.js.

Microsoft Reactor’s Make Azure AI Real series is a collection of AI livestreams that are focused on AI technical content from experts at Microsoft. It’s designed for you to learn how to use Microsoft AI tools and services, such as Azure Cognitive Services, Azure OpenAI Service, and more. You will also get insights into the latest AI trends and best practices from Microsoft AI experts. Join us for this exciting series and discover how to make AI real for your projects and goals.
 
About the session:
You might have heard a lot about the advancements of generative AI in the natural language processing (NLP) domain and how large language models reached human parity in a few NLP tasks like question and answering. However, generative AI also heavily enhanced computer vision, enabling models that perform image captioning, editing, retrieval and even generation with the highest accuracy we’ve ever seen.
In this session we cover how Azure AI vision is empowered by large foundation models and what you can do with it. We also look at the real-world use case of a startup founder looking to address food wasting with AI, by exploring several visual features on Azure AI Vision Studio and customizing a pre-trained object detector model with enterprise data.
 
Session material:
You can follow along the presentation and the demo with this Learn Module. Below the on-demand session recording:

The difficulty is that Git support for Fabric at this time is limited, and there are no ARM templates to deploy in like there is in Azure.
 
To meet these requests, I have created step-by-step instructions for these 2 patterns in our Analytics in a Box GitHub Repo. While you will be able to upload the Spark Notebooks as well as upload and run the SQL scripts used in this solution, you will follow the instructions for creating the pipelines and pipeline activities. I have tried to facilitate this by providing you with all the configurations for each pipeline and activity that you can cut and paste into each pipeline or activity setting. While this may be a bit of a laborious effort, I believe you will actually learn more about building Metadata Driven Fabric Pipelines then if you truly could just deploy from out of the box.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are happy to share that built-in Azure Monitor alerts for Azure Site Recovery is now in public preview.
 
With this integration, Azure Site Recovery users will now have:

A way to route notifications for alerts to any of the destinations supported by Azure Monitor - which includes email, ITSM, Webhook, Functions etc.
An alerting experience for Azure Site Recovery which is consistent with the alerting experience currently available for many other Azure resource types.
Enhanced flexibility in terms of choosing which scenarios to get notified for, ability to suppress notifications during planned maintenance windows, and so on.


 
Once you opt-in to this feature, Azure Site Recovery will start sending default alerts (surfaced via Azure Monitor) whenever any of the following critical events occur:

Enable disaster recovery failure alerts for Azure VM, Hyper-V, and VMware replication.
Replication health critical alerts for Azure VM, Hyper-V, and VMware replication.
Azure Site Recovery agent version expiry alerts for Azure VM and Hyper-V replication.
Azure Site Recovery agent not reachable alerts for Hyper-V replication.
Failover failure alerts for Azure VM, Hyper-V, and VMware replication.
Auto certification expiry alerts for Azure VM replication.

To test the working of the alerts for a test VM using Azure Site Recovery, you can disable public network access for the cache storage account so that a 'Replication Health turned to critical' alert is generated. Alerts are generated by default, without any need for rule configuration. However, to enable notifications (for example, email notifications) for these generated alerts, you must create an alert processing rule.
 
Follow the documentation to get started and refer to the FAQ for answers to common questions.
 
In case of any questions on the feature roadmap, please write to AskAzureBCDR@microsoft.com and we would be happy to understand your scenario in more detail.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An innovative solution has been developed to address challenges in deploying applications in distributed environments with multiple clusters. These challenges encompass scenarios like edge deployments across regions and distributing components across numerous co-located clusters. While Kubernetes is commonly used for orchestrating deployments through YAML descriptors, GitOps tools such as Flux, ArgoCD, and Jenkins X automate deployment management. However, as cluster numbers increase, issues arise regarding organization, configuration, and scalability. To tackle these challenges, a Control Plane-based deployment application has been created. It functions using a logical data model stored in an inventory database.

For WindowsAzure.ServiceBus:

We'll also end support of the SBMP protocol, so you'll no longer be able to use this protocol after 30 September 2026. You can keep using this library with the AMQP protocol after that date, but you'll no longer receive support or updates.
Azure Event Hubs previously used this library, so if you're still using it with Event Hubs you'll need to migrate your library, even if you're not using Service Bus.

However, setting up a custom domain with HTTPS Only enabled can be a bit tricky. In this blog, we will guide you through the step-by-step process of setting up a custom domain for your Azure Storage account with HTTPS Only enabled. 
 
Firstly, I would like to briefly explain that currently, configuring a custom domain directly on Azure Storage is only supported for HTTP. If HTTP access is allowed, you can follow this official documentation for configuration: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-custom-domain-name?tabs=azure-portal#map-a-custom-domain-with-only-http-enabled

Before you stream logs in real-time, enable the log type that you want. Any information written to the console output or files ending in .txt, .log, or .htm that are stored in the /home/LogFiles directory (D:\home\LogFiles) is streamed by App Service.
 
Note: Some types of logging buffer write to the log file, which can result in out of order events in the stream. For example, an application log entry that occurs when a user visits a page may be displayed in the stream before the corresponding HTTP log entry for the page request.
 
In Azure portal

If you're running distributed applications on JBoss EAP, you know that clustering is essential for data consistency and fault tolerance. We've taken this a step further on Azure App Service. Now, when you integrate JBoss EAP with an Azure Virtual Network (VNet), clustering isn't just an option; it's a built-in feature that kicks in automatically. 
 
What does this mean for your apps? For starters, it improves fault tolerance and enables more efficient data sharing across multiple instances. Your application can now handle traffic spikes and server failures better. The service scales based on your configured settings in Azure App Service, providing both vertical and horizontal options.

This migration can be driven by various factors, such as performance optimization, scalability needs, compliance requirements, or a shift in the cloud ecosystem.
 
In this comprehensive guide, we will take you on a journey through the process of migrating your data from Firebase Firestore to Azure Cosmos DB. We will begin by exploring the fundamental differences and structures of these tw…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are thrilled to announce the general availability of DenyAction, a new effect in Azure Policy! With the introduction of Deny Action, policy enforcement now expands into blocking request based on actions to the resource. These deny action policy assignments can safeguard critical infrastructure by blocking unwarranted delete calls.  
 
Azure Policy expands its at-scale enforcement capabilities to assess requests based on action. Previously, Policy only supported the ‘deny’ effect which blocks requests based on resource configurations or properties. Now a newly added effect, Deny Action, extends that functionality to block based on intended request.  
 
Deny Action effect can be leveraged in the existing policy definitions schema. This allows for the conditional flexibility that comes with the “If” structure of a policy definition. Further, by assigning these definitions at subscription or management group level, deny action can help block these actions at-scale. Applicable resources will show a “Protected” compliance state to signify that the resource is protected from an unwanted action.  
 
 
Get started   
 
Here’s a sample Custom Deny Action Definition:

In the ever-evolving landscape of API development, dealing with legacy systems and formats is a common challenge. This blog post aims to assist you in leveraging Azure API Management (APIM) to address a specific scenario: transforming XML data to JSON and vice versa. We'll delve into the techniques supported by Azure API Management that allow you to bridge the gap between these formats seamlessly.
 
Understanding the Challenge:
 
Legacy systems often communicate using XML, while modern APIs tend to rely on JSON due to its simplicity and widespread support. In scenarios where your API needs to interact with both formats, a transformation mechanism becomes crucial. Azure API Management can be the solution to ensure a smooth transition between XML and JSON.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Suppose you're deploying a web application that relies on a database. Instead of manually configuring the database each time you deploy your application, you can use an Init Container to handle this task. The Init Container can run scripts to create tables, seed initial data, or set up the database schema. Once the database is ready, the main application container can safely start, knowing that the required database structure is in place.
 
The below example defines an init container which runs under the same pod as main app container, seeds data to an existing Azure MySQL Database which will be used by the main web app container to serve contents onto the landing page.
 

 
The init container inserts a record into an existing table named myguests in Azure My SQL DB using a python script. The script contains code for connecting to the Database alongside inserting record into the Database. This data will then be retrieved and used by the main app container which is also running a python Flask based web application and return the value in the landing page.
 
Dockerfile for Init Container
 
 
 
FROM python
COPY . .
RUN pip install mysql && pip install mysql-connector-python
CMD ["python", "test.py"]

 
 
 
 
Python Script for Init Container
 
 
 
import mysql.connector

mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="init-test.mysql.database.azure.com",
  user="*******",
  password="*******",
  database="*****"
)

mycursor = mydb.cursor()

sql = "INSERT INTO myguests (firstname, lastname, email) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'test@outlook.com')"

mycursor.execute(sql)

mydb.commit()

print(mycursor.rowcount, "record(s) affected")

The last thing you want is for a code change or new feature to negatively impact your app's performance. That's where load testing swoops in to save the day. But what if we told you there's an even cooler way to handle load testing? Yep, you guessed it – automating it with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using Azure Pipelines and Azure Load Testing.
 
Why automate load tests with CI/CD?
Before we jump into the nitty-gritty, let's understand why automating load tests with CI/CD is a game-changer:

Detect issues early: By integrating load tests into your CI/CD pipeline, you can detect performance issues early . Address problems before they reach production, reducing the impact on end-users.

When using zip deploy way to deploy to function app from Azure DevOps, the new deployment never complete at DevOps side until manually cancel it.
 
Bad: 

 
Good:

 
Resolution: 
1. Enable debug log at DevOps side and then check if there are many requests to "/api/deployments/latest" with 202, if yes, continue.  
2. Check under "LogFiles/kudu/trace" in kudu portal, find log with name like below at the same time range for current deployment. If many logs show the deployment is pending at same deployment id, then continue. 

3. Go to "site/deployments" in kudu portal to find the folder whose name is same as the deployment id, then check status.xml or status_complete.xml and log.log inside the folder. If status in status.xml or status_complete.xml is not Success or Failed, then we can try to resolve the issue by removing this folder under "site/deployments".
4. Check the log with name like below under "LogFiles/kudu/trace" at the same time for the non-completed deployment task to get more details of the cause why the deployment at that time was not completed.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In some scenarios, you might need to preprocess files before they're used by your application. For instance, you're deploying a machine learning model that relies on precomputed data files. An Init Container can download, extract, or preprocess these files, ensuring they are ready for the main application container. This approach simplifies the deployment process and ensures that your application always has access to the required data.
 
The below example defines a simple Pod that has an init container which downloads a file from some resource to a file share which is shared between the init and main app container. The main app container is running a php-apache image and serves the landing page using the index.php file downloaded into the shared file space.
 

 
The init container mounts the shared volume at /mydir , and the main application container mounts the shared volume at /var/www/html. The init container runs the following command to download the file and then terminates: wget -O /mydir/index.php http://info.cern.ch. 
 
Configurations and dockerfile for init container:
 

Mount the storage file share on the environment level
Create init container with mounting file share named init on path /mydir:


 
 

Dockerfile for init which downloads an index.php file under /mydir:

 
FROM busybox:1.28 
WORKDIR / 
ENTRYPOINT ["wget", "-O", "/mydir/index.php", "http://info.cern.ch"]
 
 
 
Configuration for main app container:
 

Create main app container mounting file share named init on path /var/www/html:


 
 

Main app container configuration which uses php-apache image and serves the index.php file from DocumentRoot /var/www/html:

Azure Container App Init Containers are specialized containers that run to completion before application containers are started in a replica, and they can contain utilities or setup scripts not present in your container app image. Init containers are useful for performing initialization logic such as setting up accounts, running setup scripts, and configuring databases.
 
Init containers are exactly like regular containers, except:

Azure has a nice little tool to manage certificates and bring them to your virtual machines, but it is not that well documented: welcome to the Azure Key Vault extension.
 
Prompted by my awesome colleague Bruna Moreira, I decided to have a look at it. Long story short: it does what it promises (copying and refreshing digital certificates from Azure Key Vault into your virtual machine) and it does it well, but you need to know a couple of little secrets to make it work.

While if App Service enables Private Endpoint, the webhook from container registry should be blocked with 403 since the public access to the App Service kudu site (advanced tool site) is blocked by default. And when webhook event is trying sent to app service via Private Endpoint, it should fail with IP forbidden.


 
With the situation, this blog provide a workaround by allowing webhook IP to access App Service kudu site via public access and keep the remaining traffic go through Private Endpoint. So the diagram as below:

Query data in Azure Resource Graph
As Azure Resource Graph continues to expose more valuable data, you can now create cross-service queries between Log Analytics workspaces and Azure Resource Graph.
Here are some sample Azure Log Analytics queries that use the new Azure Resource Graph cross-service query capabilities:
 

Filter a Log Analytics query based on the results of an Azure Resource Graph query

- Filter your KQL query to get only virtual machines that are from Standard_D typle that has data:
 
arg("").Resources
| where type == "microsoft.compute/virtualmachines" and properties.hardwareProfile.vmSize startswith "Standard_D"
| join (
    Heartbeat
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
    | distinct Computer
    )
    on $left.name == $right.Computer
 

Create an alert rule that applies only to certain resources taken from an ARG query- Exclude resources based on tags – for example, not to trigger alerts for VMs with a “Test” tag.

arg(״״).Resources| where tags.environment=~'Test'| project name - Retrieve performance data related to CPU utilization and filter to resources with the “prod” tag:

        <link href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/how-to-detect-java-dependency-version-conflict-using-idea-maven/ba-p/3915091"/>
        <updated>2023-09-01T01:34:15.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Java dependency version conflict occurs when two or more dependencies in your project have incompatible versions of the same class or resource. This can cause runtime errors, unexpected behavior, or compilation failures in your Java application. Sometimes it is hard to detect them, while with the help of IDEA Maven Helper, it has never been so simple.
 
1. Install the plugin
In IntelliJ IDEA, choose File -> Settings -> Plugins. Within the Marketplace tab, search for Maven Helper and click Install.

 
2. Leverage the plugin
Open the pom.xml file of your project and switch to the Dependency Analyzer tab at the bottom.

You will see three options: Conflicts, All Dependencies as List, and All Dependencies as Tree. Choose Conflicts to see if there are any dependency conflicts in your project.

 
3. Resolve conflict
To resolve a conflict, you can right-click on a dependency on the left panel and choose Exclude. This will add an exclusion tag to your pom.xml file and remove the dependency from your project. Alternatively, you can also choose a compatible version of the dependency that works with all other dependencies and declare it explicitly in your pom.xml file using the dependencyManagement section.
After resolving a conflict, you can refresh the Dependency Analyzer tab to see if there are any remaining conflicts. You can also use the All Dependencies as List or All Dependencies as Tree options to see all the dependencies in your project in different formats.

 
4. Conclusion
Dependency conflicts can be difficult to detect, but they can cause a lot of problems in the project. By using the above-mentioned technique and following best practices to prevent dependency conflicts, you can ensure your application runs smoothly without any issues.

APIs often return a large amount of data. Pagination allows you to retrieve a manageable subset of this data at a time, preventing unnecessary strain on resources and reducing the likelihood of timeouts or errors.
In this example, the client starts by requesting the first page of data from the server. The server responds with both the data and metadata indicating the current page, the total number of records. The client then proceeds to request subsequent pages of data until it reaches the last page. This approach allows for efficient data retrieval and processing without overwhelming the client or the server.

Let’s look at some of the CURL command syntax to perform REST API operations and will be making use of SAS as the auth scheme for most of the operations. We need to take care of the pointers below while performing the operations via CURL:
 

Ensure the URL is formed correctly as per the operation you are trying to perform.
The header needs to be passed and can be done using “-H” parameter.
Ensure you are appending/removing extra ‘?’ to the SAS token in the URLs accordingly.
Http verb can be GET, PUT, PATCH or DELETE as provided by the CURL specifications.

These models used SQL queries in import tables, which are now required to be changed to M queries to implement OAuth authentication. This paper discusses the challenges faced during this migration and presents a Python script as a solution to automate the conversion process.
Background: Tabular models are structured as BIM files containing various elements like data sources, measures, relationships, dimensions, queries, and roles in a nested JSON format.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Plotting "unique users" charts from API Management logs
It is quite a common requirement when working with API gateways (such as Azure API Management) to understand how many users are actively accessing your applications in the backend. However, the solution for that is not the same for everyone. For instance, a metric exposed out-of-the-box is the total number of HTTP requests... but that doesn't tell us how many unique users we have. Normally, an application running in the client devices generates multiple HTTP requests towards the backend.
So... How can we get the number of active and unique users from Azure API Management data?

        <updated>2023-08-22T09:37:50.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We can follow the below steps to remove the PHP X-Powered-By header from HTTP response for PHP 8.x apps on Linux App Service –
By default, PHP version is getting displayed as in the below screenshot-

 
 Updating PHP Settings-

Go to your KUDU site https://<sitename>.scm.azurewebsites.net.
Select Bash or SSH from the top menu.
In Bash/SSH, go to your "/home/site" directory.
Create a directory called "ini" (i.e. mkdir ini)
Change directories to "ini".
We'll need to create an "ini" file to add our settings to.  In this example, I'm using "settings.ini".  There are no file editors such as Vi, Vim, or Nano so we'll simply use echo to add the settings to the file.  I'm changing the expose_php setting to Off.  Below is the command that I used to add the setting and create an "settings.ini" file if one doesn't already exist.

 NOTE:  If you already have an extensions.ini file, you can use the same command which will add the new setting to the file. 
/home/site/ini>echo " expose_php = Off " >> settings.ini
If using SSH, you can use vi to create/edit the settings file using the following commands.

 vi settings.ini
 Press "i" on your keyboard to start editing and add the following.

 expose_php = Off  
3. Press "Esc", then ":wq!" and enter to save.
Add an Application Setting-
We'll now need to go to the Azure Portal and add an Application Setting to scan the "ini" directory
              1) Go to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com) and select your App Service Linux PHP application.
              2) Select Application Settings for the app.
              3) Under the Application settings section, press the "+ Add new setting".
              4) For the App Setting Name, enter "PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR". For the value, enter "/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d:/home/site/ini"
 
Testing – 
Go to kudu site and run the command below and you can verify that PHP header is removed.
CURL -I <site url pointing to a PHP script>]]></summary>

The first step is to exit their on-premises data centers and rapidly relocate their legacy application VMs to the Azure VMware Solution as a staging area for the first phase of their modernization strategy. What should the Azure VMware Solution look like?

This operation is mainly used for uploading large files or data streams in smaller blocks, rather than uploading the entire content in a single request.
 
There can be different types of errors that you might encounter while uploading blobs via Put Block and Put Block List and has been discussed under blog - Troubleshooting InvalidBlock 'The specified block list is invalid’ based errors - Microsoft Community Hub.

Azure Static Web Apps is the ideal service for hosting modern frontend web apps and static sites on Azure. Many customers rely on Static Web Apps to host their HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, Angular, Blazor or NextJS apps (among others!), and they complement these with their APIs, microservices and other services such as databases. At times though, these downstream services are isolated within a virtual network, preventing access from Static Web Apps’ managed Azure Functions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction:Data partitioning is a data management technique used to divide a large dataset into smaller, more manageable subsets called partitions or shards. Each partition contains a portion of the data, and these partitions can be stored and processed independently. The primary goal of data partitioning is to improve performance, scalability, and manageability in large-scale data systems.Imagine having a vast encyclopedia, and your task is to find a specific page containing a particular word. Instead of searching through the entire encyclopedia, you opt to navigate directly to the relevant section that might contain the desired information. This approach allows you to narrow down your search scope and quickly find the page you need. This concept of narrowing down the search space by di…]]></summary>

Visual Studio utilizes many caches to increase the performance of key features like Find in Files and IntelliSense. When opening a solution for the first time these caches must be generated by indexing and processing the codebase. Working with large solutions can add a significant amount of time to startup while these caches are created. Once the caches are created Visual Studio can quickly use these features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaler (KEDA) lets you drive the scaling of any container in Kubernetes based on the load to be processed, by querying metrics from systems such as Prometheus.
 
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) supports integration of KEDA with your AKS cluster to scale your workloads based on Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus metrics from your Azure Monitor workspace.
 
Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus (also known as Managed Prometheus in Azure) is a fully managed Prometheus service in Azure (it includes a fully managed data store, query service, ruler service, Prometheus compatible query APIs, and managed add-on for data collection from, ARC-connected on-prem or other cloud Kubernetes offerings). As a first step, this service is fully integrated with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as an add-on which scrapes Prometheus metrics.
 
To integrate KEDA into your Azure Kubernetes Service, you will need to deploy and configure a workload identity or pod identity on your cluster. This identity allows KEDA to authenticate with Azure and retrieve metrics for scaling from your Monitor workspace.
 
We recommend using Azure Active Directory workload identity. This authentication method replaces pod-managed identity (pod-managed identity in AKS has been deprecated as of 10/24/2022), which integrates with the Kubernetes native capabilities to federate with any external identity providers on behalf of the application.
 
Azure Managed Prometheus support starts from KEDA v2.10. If you have an older version of KEDA installed, you must upgrade in order to work with Azure Managed Prometheus.
 
To integrate KEDA into your AKS, please start with our documentation, and reach out to us should you have any feedback or questions!]]></summary>

Epoch is a unique identifier (epoch value) that the service uses, to enforce partition/lease ownership. Thus, epoch features allow one consumer to have exclusive access to a partition despite the competition from other consumers from the same consumer group to use that same partition. This protocol is used from the Event Processor Host (EPH) SDK by using CreateEpochReceiver method. For more information, please visit the following link.

Once you set up a new WordPress website on App Service, you can access your website using the URL <app-name>.azurewebsites.net. Custom Domains are domain names that reflect your brand or company. For example, microsoft.com is the custom domain used by Microsoft for their website. In this article, we will learn about how we can use Custom Domains and subdomains with our WordPress website on App Service.
 
You can buy an App Service domain and use it with your WordPress website. App Service Domains are custom domains that are managed directly in Azure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Q1: What are cipher suites and how do they work on App Service?

A cipher suite is a set of instructions that contains algorithms and protocols to help secure network connections between clients and servers. By default, the front-end’s OS would pick the most secure cipher suite that is supported by both the front-end and the client. However, if the client only supports weak cipher suites, then the front-end’s OS would pick a weak cipher suite that they both support.
App Service does SSL termination on the Frontend layer, which happens before the frontend instances forward requests to workers.

Introduction
As an educator, grading tests and assignments is a challenging and time-consuming task. The process involves several steps, such as collecting all completed scripts, reviewing the standard answers and marking for each question, assigning marks, and repeating the process for each student. Once all questions have been marked, the total score for each student must be calculated and entered into a spreadsheet. Finally, the scored scripts are returned to the students.

        <updated>2023-07-24T07:26:58.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are multiple ways to increase the concurrency of python function app. I drew an architecture diagram, which can give us an overall understanding of the function app.
 

Based on the diagram, we can see we could increase function app concurrency by increasing instance count, python worker count and thread count. To better understand this, I build several labs to validate this. I will not demonstrate instance count as it is easy to understand. All these labs are having 4 concurrent incoming requests and each request takes 10 seconds to complete.
 
Lab1:
code:
sync

Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=1
Result:
It took 40 seconds to complete the 4 executions. We can see these 4 executions were triggered at the same time, this is because the function host level is using async. But actually these executions are executed one by one.

Lab2:
code: The same as Lab1.
Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=2
Result:
It took 20 seconds to complete the 4 executions.

 
Lab3:
code: The same as Lab1.
Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=2PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=2
Result:
It took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.

Lab4:
code:
async

Configuration:
maxConcurrentRequests : 4FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT=1PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT=1
Result:
It took 10 seconds to complete the 4 executions.

 
Conclusion:
1.We can increase the concurrency by increasing FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT and PYTHON_THREADPOOL_THREAD_COUNT. Just note that we can configure the concurrent setting in host.json file. This is the bottleneck of the concurrency. 
2.It is more recommended to use async method instead of sync method as async has better performance than sync with the same configuration.

As a container app revision scales out, new instances of the revision are created on-demand. These instances are known as replicas.
Adding or editing scaling rules creates a new revision of your container app. A revision is an immutable snapshot of your container app. 
 
Scaling is driven by different categories of triggers - this blog discusses HTTP and Custom triggers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a PHP developer, sometimes you might want to set the custom configuration file (.ini) to read when PHP starts up. For this article, I would like demonstrate how to load custom configuration file (.ini) in the Azure App Service.
 
By default, we set the PHP_INI_DIR = /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d, so when using SSH on Kudu, you could see there are lots of .ini files:

 
Based on this, you might think we could just manually add our custom .ini files in /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d, but it will not work after restart. Since only "/home" data will be persistent after restarting App Service. So what we need to do is to add our .ini in "/home", E.g. "/home/site/ini"
 
For example, if I would like to modify "upload_max_filesize to 64M (defualt is 2M) and post_max_size to 64M (default is 8M)" for the PHP website, I could follow the below steps to achieve it:
 
Step 1:
Use like vi/vim command to add setting.ini file in the "/home/site/ini" folder

 
Step 2:
PHP supports scanning multiple directories for .ini files. For this we need to set PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR with ":" to separate values on the Application Setting for the target App Service.
E.g. PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR = :/home/site/ini
This ensures that we load *.ini files from  /usr/local/etc/php and then load from /home/site/ini

 
 
After, we check the value by simple php page and it will show upload_max_size and post_max_size are set as 64M now.

Why send Syslog data to Sentinel 
Syslog data can help you monitor security and health of your AKS workloads. By sending Syslog data to Sentinel, you can use its cloud native SIEM features to detect and respond to threats, investigate incidents, and create dashboards and reports for your Kubernetes workloads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overview
  The SSV2 feature starts or stops Azure Virtual Machines instances across multiple subscriptions. It starts or stops virtual machines on user-defined   schedules, provides insights through Azure Application Insights, and sends optional notifications by using action groups.
  Azure offers an ARM template for deployment. So, you can easily deploy SSV2 using GitHub.
  For more detail, please see the SSV2 docs.
 
Purpose of SSV2
 The main purpose of using SSV2 is to save costs. By using Scheduled SSV2, we can turn on the VM only during business hours (ex. 9AM-6PM) and shut it down the rest of the time. Also, we can set the VM to automatically shut down when not in use by the Auto Stop function.In this post, I focus on how much we can save VM resource costs using SSV2.

To keep pace, developers consistently turn Java as their language of choice, and the Azure platform for the build-to-deploy process. Azure not only supplies developers with their favorite environments but allows them to integrate with other apps in the Microsoft partner ecosystem. Learning about Java development on Microsoft Azure can be a great way for developers to hone their skills and create robust, versatile applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Static Web App offers two types of preview environments: branch environment and named environment. Both of these methods offer isolated environments for testing and deploying changes to your Azure Static Web App, allowing you to test and validate changes without affecting the main production environment.
 
Here are the steps to create a preview environment:
 
1. After deploying the production branch to the main site, create a new branch based on the main branch and name it "dev".


 
2. Modify your YAML file in the dev branch to include "dev" in the trigger to track any changes in the dev branch.

 
3. Set "production_branch" to the name of your production branch. This action will ensure the deploy task in the dev branch creates a new preview environment.

 
4. Save the changes and after deployment, you can see a new environment named 'dev' for the dev branch.

 
5. If you want to name a preview environment separately (instead of using the branch name), set the "deployment_environment" to the desired name, and it will create a named environment.

 

 
The main difference between branch and named environments is that branch environments are created automatically based on the branch name, whereas named environments are custom-named. 
 
Overall, both branch and named environments provide isolated environments for testing and deploying changes to your Azure Static Web App, allowing you to test and validate changes without affecting the main production environment. The choice of environment type typically depends on the specific needs and development process of your project.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Encrypting data at rest is a primary step in securing a Kubernetes cluster. KMS provides an interface for a provider to utilize a key stored in an external key service to perform this encryption. While KMS v1 on AKS enabled the encryption of Kubernetes secrets using a key in Azure Key Vault, it was limited to only supporting encryption of 2000 secrets. To address this limitation, the Azure Container Upstream team, in collaboration with the Kubernetes community, spearheaded the enhancement project. After being part of two Kubernetes releases, this feature has graduated to beta in Kubernetes v1.27. As soon as KMS v2 became beta in v1.27, Microsoft promptly made it available on AKS as one of many security enhancement features available to its users. For a full list of KMSv2 enhancements, check out this Kubernetes blog post.
For clusters at version v1.27+ with KMS newly enabled, KMS v2 is configured by default. However, for clusters with KMS enabled at versions below v1.27, upgrading to v1.27 will be blocked . To upgrade, follow the steps outlined in this documentation for migrating from KMS v1 to v2, and then proceed with upgrading the cluster to version v1.27. Running your v1.27 AKS cluster with KMS v2 feature enabled, you can now encrypt more than 2000 secrets.]]></summary>

The loading is due to the container starting (Alpine Linux and NodeJS). Cold Starts are not really a thing for workloads under regular load.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overview:
We can secure a custom DNS name with the help of TLS/SSL binding in Azure App Service.
 
When hosting a website on Azure App Service, it is important to ensure that the site is secure and can be accessed via a custom domain name. This can be achieved by using TLS/SSL binding, which encrypts data transmitted to and from the website, thereby ensuring that sensitive information is protected. With this setup, users can access the website via a custom domain name, which adds an extra layer of professionalism and branding to the site.
 
Issue:
The users are not able to purchase and bind the app service certificate for their app service having a custom domain with a special character from Azure Portal.
 
Solution and recommendations:

Azure by default does not provide the facility to purchase the custom domain with the special character except periods and dashes.

 


The user can purchase the custom domain outside Azure with special characters apart from periods and dashes.
In this case, the user will not be able to purchase the App Service Certificate from Azure with the custom domain consists a special character.
To purchase and bind the Certificate with such domain from Azure Portal, the custom domain first needs to be converted to its Punny code using the below converter:

 
Punycode converter (IDN converter), Punycode to Unicode :wrench:(punycoder.com)

 

Purchase the certificate with the Punny code custom domain and bind the certificate with the app service custom domain.

Add and manage TLS/SSL certificates - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn
 

Browse the app service to verify the SSL Certificate.


 
If this helps you, do let me know via like and comments section, cheers!
Happy Learning!

Have you ever built a machine learning model and asked yourself what is the next step? Bingo, Deploying the machine learning model to the internet to be able to use it anywhere you want. Sometimes, you struggle with this process and may find yourself asking the following questions:
What are the accepted formats for my model?
How can I do it?
What are the things that I need in order to deploy my model?
 
In this blog, we will go through a step-by-step coding guide, from converting our model to ONNX format until we use it in our Power Apps application.
 
Technical Architecture
We will start by creating a resource group inside the Azure Platform and then creating an Azure Machine Learning Workspace, Compute, and Notebook. Inside the notebook, we will run some code that will help us t…]]></summary>

Azure Event Hubs is a big data streaming platform that collects events from multiple sources to be ingested by Azure and external services.  
The new ability to ingest data can be powerful for customers who already use message queueing mechanisms and are interested in ingesting data into a Log Analytics or Sentinel workspace, or ingesting into multiple destinations.
Customers who use Kafka can connect their applications to a Kafka endpoint on an event hub without any code changes.
 
The main benefits of this feature are:

Highly scalable and reliable ingestion - start ingest megabytes of data and grow to gigabytes or terabytes.
Fully managed service that doesn’t require use and maintenance of other components like functions, Logic Apps, and plugins to ingest data from Event Hubs into a Log Analytics workspace.
Requires minimum configuration with flexibility to add more advanced configurations using transformations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a web technology designed to enable servers to transmit data to clients without the need for client-initiated requests. SSE proves to be highly advantageous for applications requiring real-time updates, such as chat platforms, news feeds, or stock price trackers. Traditionally, these applications would involve clients repeatedly requesting data from servers at predefined intervals.
 
This blog post delves into the configuration process of setting up a server-sent events (SSE) API within Azure API Management (APIM). APIM is a comprehensive service offering the creation, publication, management, and security of APIs. APIM facilitates SSE APIs by applying a specialized policy that enables the seamless transmission of streaming responses.

Have you ever walked into a store, did some shopping, and headed back home only to find that you forgot to buy 60% of the items you needed to get?
I struggle with this very same issue and so I decided to create the ‘Smart Shopping Planner’, an application that will help me keep track of the items I need to buy and that I can easily update before and after shopping.
 
Smart Shopping Planner is a React application built using JavaScript, that stores data in an Azure SQL database. In this blog, I want to show you how incredibly easy it was to provide REST endpoints (you can work with GraphQL too) to connect the app to the database.

Federated credentials / workload identity federation allows your CI/CD pipelines in GitHub and GitLab to access your Azure subscription without any secrets stored in the pipeline config.
GitHub's azure/login@1 task handles this transparently, but I also explain how it works under the hood. GitLab supplies the necessary token directly to your pipeline run.
Both GitHub and GitLab are easy to setup and federate securely with your Azure subscription.
BitBucket can't be setup that way, because tokens issued by BitBucket don't have a predicable subject identifier.

Overview
This article demonstrates how to configure, and securely access, an Azure environment from within a GitHub and a GitLab CI/CD pipeline, without having to store credentials on the GitHub/GitLab side. The article also br…]]></summary>

In a previous blog, I asked the concluding question:


How will industry and jobs change in the co-pilot first world(where humans and AI work together and AI is the co-pilot)? 
What will that mean to pedagogy and evaluation?

In this blog, I explain how such a framework could be implemented through the use of prompt engineering for GPT to create a reflective, deeper format for learning. We are exploring some of these ideas in our AI courses at the University of Oxford, however all views expressed here are solely my own. We are also developing these ideas as a platform for our edtech start-up with Pinckney Benedict (Salooki).
