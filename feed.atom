At the time I said I would avoid bringing in .NET Aspire as it was in preview and earlier explorations pointed to it being somewhat buggy in those preliminary stages.
 
About a month ago at Build .NET Aspire went GA so that raises the question anew - should I use Aspire? Let's revisit our sample app and take a closer look.

In this blog post we will learn how to do Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using local resources in .NET! We’ll show you how to combine the Phi-3 language model, Local Embeddings, and Semantic Kernel to create a RAG scenario.
What is RAG?
Before we dive into the demo, let’s quickly recap what RAG is. RAG is a hybrid approach that enhances the capabilities of a language model by incorporating external knowledge. In example: using a RAG approach we can retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base and use them to generate more informed and accurate responses. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a LLM needs up-to-date information or specific domain knowledge that isn't contained within its initial training data.

Introduction
 
Hi, I am Khalid Abdelaty a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, studying Computer Science Student @ Tanta University in Egypt. I am fancisanted by the opportunity of AI and  the ability to analyze and interpret data.
 
Power BI has seen massive growth in the past couple of years in the IT industry. With the exponential growth of data, employees face challenges in data governance. To manage this unmeasurable data, we need reliable storage solutions. Microsoft Azure facilitates the integration of Power BI with services such as SQL, Stream Analytics, and many others. This combination enhances the ability to work with complex data efficiently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year at BUILD we announced the public preview of the Network Observability add-on. Today we’re excited to share a massive upgrade to the network observability capabilities available to AKS customers. 
 
What’s new?
We are excited to announce Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS), a suite of services built to significantly enhance the operational capabilities of your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. Advanced Network Observability is the inaugural feature of the ACNS suite bringing the power of Hubble’s control plane to both Cilium and Non-Cilium Linux data planes. With Advanced Network Observability, customers can now pinpoint network-related issues with more precision and detect root causes faster.  The offering provides pod level packet statistics, DNS statistics, L4 connections and enhanced debugging capabilities with network flow logs and DNS error tracking.
Data flow for Advanced Network Observability
 
How can Azure customers use the new offering?
ACNS is integrated deeply with existing Azure Monitor capabilities for monitoring AKS clusters. Using the new capabilities requires no extra configuration from customers. Customers can enable advanced network observability with a single command. The metrics are then ingested automatically by Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus. Additionally, customers can visualize the metrics in pre-built dashboards in Azure Managed Grafana. Customers have access to 6 pre-built dashboards in Azure Managed Grafana covering a breadth of signals from cluster traffic to DNS and pod level flows.

How to get ACNS

Believe it or not, not all data is meant for analytics. Sometimes reporting requirements include flat data that is not inherently dimensional. This often includes querying large tables with low cardinality columns. Think of:

Audit trails – understanding who accessed what at a certain point in time or what events occurred when
Financial transaction data – querying financial transactions by invoice id
Web analytics – identifying which pages were accessed at what date, time and location

This type of data can have millions or billions of rows to sift through.

RAG uses information from additional sources to enhance the output of a large language model (LLM).  If you’ve used LLMs like ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot, you’ve probably gotten your fair share of hallucinations, responses that are wrong, often to the point of silliness. In fact, Microsoft Copilot comes with a warning: “Copilot uses AI. Check for mistakes.” RAG grounds the responses in authoritative external knowledge making them more accurate and useful.

In our latest video, we went into the fascinating world of Redis and its integration with AI, specifically focusing on how it can enhance .NET applications.
 
Redis and .NET
 
Bruno, Katherine, and Stanley shared their insights on leveraging Redis for building intelligent, high-performance applications. They showcased two compelling demo applications:
 

A .NET Contoso HR web application augmented with AI and Redis for chatbot-style capabilities.
An eShop web application enhanced with AI for intelligent recommendations and improved performance.

The discussion also touched upon key concepts such as large language models, vector similarity search, and retrieval augmented generative AI, providing a comprehensive overview of the technical landscape. The integration of Redis with Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise was particularly emphasized, showcasing its ability to support vector similarity search and offer low latency, which is crucial for real-time applications.
 
This session was a testament to the power of combining Redis with AI to create more dynamic, responsive, and intelligent applications.
 
Resources
For those eager to dive deeper, several resources were shared.
 

Blog: https://aka.ms/redis-ai/04-2024
Documentation:https://aka.ms/redis-ai/vss
Redis branch at https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo-csharp/tree/redis
Vss branch at https://github.com/CawaMS/eShop/tree/vss

These resources provide a great starting point for developers looking to integrate Redis and AI into their own projects.

AI is all about probability, and the probability of it being incorrect, or behaving unexpectedly for a new input is practically never zero. In the classic chatbot days, this often meant getting an answer about something you're not asking about, or the good old "I did not understand" default answer we all "love" to see when we're having an issue. But with Generative AI, mistakes are much more nuanced, and may take the appearance of plain misinformation and, even worse, harmful content!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever wanted to create your own website or web service, but felt overwhelmed about how to get started with web development? Or have you already built a web app with Python, but wondered how you can deploy it online? If so, you might be interested in watching this video by and Pamela Fox and Renee Noble, two Python Cloud Advocates at Microsoft with a passion for web development and education!
 
They’ll show you how to create a web app with Python Flask (or it’s async-sibling Quart) and show you how you can deploy you can take your web app live by deploying it on Azure. This is the first episode in this live stream series (which you can also catch on demand!) by Pamela and friends covering different web dev frameworks and practices! (And you can catch it in Spanish too!)



 
In this video, you will learn how the web works and why you (likely) need a web server to serve up your web app. You will also discover how a backend web framework, like Flask, helps you develop your web server quickly and easily and how it lets you use templates to build dynamic sites - whether it’s your first site or a complex full-scale service.
 
Want to improve your web server throughput? Find out how you can port your app to Quart, the asynchronous version of Flask. And of course, you’ll see how you can deploy your web apps to Azure App Service in minutes and learn what other deployment options you might be interested in seeking out depending on your project.
 
The video is perfect for beginners who have some familiarity with Python, but no prior experience with web development or deployment. It is also suitable for intermediate or advanced developers who want to refresh their skills or learn new tricks. Take a look at the video to learn some concepts and follow along with our coding and deployment demos! You can grab the demo repo here and check out the slides too.]]></summary>

Why we use it
An increasing number of security vulnerabilities are caused by sensitive information in the source code being leaked or accidentally uploaded to open repositories GitHub, leading to the exposure of a large amount of user privacy. This information includes, but is not limited to, database credentials, app keys, etc. Traditional MySQL databases use usernames and passwords for login operations, naturally leading to the inclusion of these credentials in project configuration files. Even with proper safeguards, there remain unpredictable risks, such as hacking.
 
This tutorial will introduce how to integrate Microsoft Entra with Azure Database for MySQL to avoid using fixed usernames and passwords. By utilizing system-ass…]]></summary>

Note: For the purpose of this article, I'm going to use Entra ID to refer to a user identity, as well as a managed identity such as a service principal, as the approach is the same in this context here.
The above linked documentation covers how you would setup the Azure resource with Entra ID as the authentication mode, so I won't go over that here (also, you can configure that when you initial create the database, or using a Bicep script), instead I want to look at how we use that in a .NET application, because when you're connecting using Entra ID you don't have a pas…]]></summary>

We have seen that before load testing these endpoints, most users generate an access token and store it in the Azure Key Vault.

First, let’s provide an overview of how Cosmos DB is being used in this scenario. As per the architectural overview shown below, there are an ecosystem of Customer systems that emit data, these hit a pipeline and are then inserted into Cosmos DB via a Batch process.

 
The original design from 2019 had only a single container, Data, which contained all of the documents that were ingested into Cosmos DB. As the Data Container grew and reached a point where Query performance and RU/s became prohibitive. An Index Container was introduced to function as an 'Index' for the Data Container. This design change mandated the following data access pattern:

Azure Load Testing is a cloud-based service that lets you test the performance and scalability of your web applications and APIs. You can create and run load tests, analyze and compare the results, and define test fail criteria based on metrics like response time, error percentage, and throughput.
Response time is the time your application takes to respond to a user request. It depends on factors like network latency, server load, and application logic. To measure the performance of your application, you need to look at the response time distribution across different percentiles, which show how many requests are completed within a certain time limit. For example, the 90th percentile response time means that 90% of the requests are completed within that time, and the remaining …]]></summary>

Users are required to manually configure Microsoft Entra Workload ID or Managed Identities so their AKS workloads can securely access these protected resources.
The Service Connector integration greatly simplifies the connection configuration experience for AKS workloads and Azure backing services. Service Connector takes care of authentication and network configurations securely and follows Azure best practices, so you can focus on your application code without worrying about your infrastructure connectivity.

Service Connector Action Breakdown
 
Before, in order to connect from AKS pods to a private Azure backing services using workload identity, users needed to perform the following actions manually:

Create a managed identity
Retrieve the OIDC issuer URL
Create Kubernetes service account
Establish federated identity credential trust
Grant permissions to access Azure Services
Deploy the application

Now, Service Connector performs steps 2 to 5 automatically. Additionally, for Azure services without public access, Service Connector creates private connection components such as private link, private endpoint, DNS record,
You can create a connection in the Service Connection blade within AKS.

 
Click create and select the target service, authentication method, and networking rule. The connection will then be automatically set up. Here are a few helpful links to for you to learn more about Service Connector.

 However, managed identity can be enabled with the Azure PowerShell command: Set-AzWebApp -AssignIdentity. Furthermore, this command can be executed by utilizing a unique resource type known as deploymentScripts.

¿Te lo perdiste? No te preocupes, aquí te hacemos un resumen y te compartimos el video y algunos recursos para que puedas seguir aprendiendo.
 
Contenido


Bruno Capuano mostró cómo cambiar entre modelos locales y en la nube con semantic kernel. 3:40


Francis Nicole mostró cómo usar Custom Vision para entrenar un modelo de detección de imágenes con un personaje de dibujos animados, usando Language Studio y Azure portal. También explicó las métricas de rendimiento y los resultados del modelo. 10:47


Pablo Di Loreto presentó algunos servicios de Azure AI que no son generativos, pero útiles para el procesamiento de lenguaje natural y la IA conversacional, como análisis de texto, extracción de frases clave y respuesta a preguntas personalizadas. También demostró cómo usar Language Studio y Azure Bot Service para crear un chatbot con preguntas frecuentes. 21:21


Luis Beltrán explicó cómo usar Azure Functions y SQL para crear un motor de búsqueda de productos basado en embeddings. También mostró cómo usar Azure OpenAI para generar embeddings y Azure Communication Services para conectar con WhatsApp. 33:17

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are pleased to announce the public preview of large message support (up to 20 MB) in Azure Event Hubs. Azure Event Hubs is a cloud native data streaming service that can stream millions of events per second, with low latency, from any source to any destination. Event Hubs is compatible with Apache Kafka, and it enables you to run existing Kafka workloads without any code changes.
 
The introduction of large message support is a significant enhancement to our service. Typically, data in streaming scenarios is lightweight, often less than 1 MB, and characterized by high throughput. However, there are instances when messages cannot be divided into smaller segments or chunks.
 
With the new support for large messages, Event Hubs self-serve scalable Dedicated clusters can now accommodate events up to 20 MB in size at no additional cost. This capability allows Azure Event Hubs to handle a wide range of message sizes, ensuring uninterrupted business operations.
 
How to enable large message support for Event Hubs
 
Large message streaming is only supported in Event Hubs self-serve scalable dedicated clusters built out of latest infrastructure. For more details, visit aka.ms/largemessagesupportforeh
 
Being able to stream large messages or events requires no client code changes apart from the change in message or event itself. You could continue sending/receiving messages using any existing event hubs SDK / Kafka API to stream large messages to event hub.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker with message queues and publish-subscribe topics. Sometimes, you may want to delete messages from your queues and subscriptions in a more programmatic manner, for example, to clear out old or unwanted messages from your entities.  
 
We are excited to announce the public preview of Batch Delete, a new feature that lets you delete messages in bulk from your Service Bus entities. Batch delete helps you to delete multiple messages from a messaging entity in one operation, instead of deleting them one by one. Since deletion is done at service side, you don't need to receive the messages before deleting them.

We are sure you will find the Batch Delete feature a significant improvement in Azure Service Bus and encourage you to explore this new addition.

Event Hubs is compatible with Apache Kafka, and it enables you to run existing Kafka workloads without any code changes.
 
Recognizing the critical need for local development support for Azure Event Hubs, we’re thrilled to roll out the preview release of the local emulator for Azure Event Hubs. Azure Event Hubs emulator is designed to offer a local development experience for Azure Event Hubs, enabling you to develop and test code against our services in isolation, free from cloud interference.
 
Get started with Azure Event Hubs emulator
 
The emulator is available as a Docker image on Microsoft Container Registry and is platform-agnostic – it can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can either use our automated scripts from the Installer repository or spin up the emulator container using the docker compose command.
 
The emulator is compatible with the latest Event Hubs SDKs and supports basic send and receive operations with Azure Event Hubs via AMQP.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, we're excited to announce that compression for Kafka clients is generally available in Azure Event Hubs.
 
Azure Event Hubs is a cloud native streaming service enabling you to build scalable, durable and low-latency workflows with massive volumes of event data with ease. As you onboard more workloads to Azure and build them around Azure Event Hubs, your bandwidth and storage requirements may scale exponentially.
 
Kafka compression can help with this by reducing the data payloads that are stored and transmitted across your architecture, thus reducing network bandwidth and storage requirements and costs, while still keeping the programming model simple.
 
To utilize Kafka compression, you must set the below setting in the Kafka producer configuration properties -
 
 
compression.type = gzip
 
 
 
No changes are required on the Kafka consumer side, since the compression information is made available in the message header and the consumer can automagically uncompress these and make it available for processing.

CI/CD is a system that automates steps in software delivery. For WordPress developers, it means less manual work: once you push updates, the system automatically tests and deploys them. It's like having a assistant that not only speeds up your work but also checks for errors with each update, ensuring your WordPress site runs smoothly. This constant testing and feedback loop means you can fix bugs quickly and improve your site continuously without disrupting the live version. In short, CI/CD makes your development process faster, more efficient, and less error prone.

A staging site, also called as a development site, testing site, or sandbox – is a clone of your actual WordPress website which cannot be accessed by your visitors. This can only be accessed by people who have the staging URL.
 
Why do you need a staging site for your WordPress website?
A staging site is extremely useful when you are working on a WordPress website. It provides a safe area for development, testing, and experimentation. When you are trying out a new plugin, theme or custom code, there are chances that the website might break leading to downtime for your users, or even cause irreparable damage to your website like loss of content and data.

Adopting RAG empowers businesses to leverage external knowledge, enhance accuracy, and create more robust AI applications. It’s a strategic move toward building intelligent systems that bridge the gap between generative capabilities and authoritative information. Below are topics in this blog. 

Brief History of AI 
What are Large Language Models (LLMS). 
Limitation of LLMS. 
How can we incorporate domain knowledge. 
What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

The recent advances in LLMs have created opportunities for businesses to gain new insight into their unstructured text data. A classic example of this has been using the popular Retrieval Augmented Generation pattern (e.g. https://github.com/Azure/GPT-RAG) in which enterprise documents are used as context to answer user questions. These implementations can reduce time spent sifting through lengthy documentation and promote awareness throughout an organization.
 
But what about using LLMs to extract insights from structured relational data such as SQL databases? Many enterprises possess enormous amounts of SQL data that currently requires technical expertise to query or build business dashboards to make this data accessible to end users. However, it is costly to build these das…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, and welcome to the recap of our latest video on AI and .NET.
 
In this video, we talked about some of the exciting projects and samples that we have been working on to help you get started with AI using .NET. We also answered some of the questions that you asked us in the previous episode, such as:

How to work with local models
How to use semantic kernel
How to evaluate different models.

 
One of the main topics that we discussed was the AI samples repo, where we are adding artificial intelligence samples for .NET developers. You can find scenarios such as text summarization, chat, data generation, image generation, and more. You can also choose between using semantic kernel or the Azure Open AI SDK to interact with the models.
 
We also showed you how to switch between different models, such as GPT-4, Phi-3 and Llama, using the same code and API. We also shared some links to other resources, such as the Azure Developer .NET Day, where you can learn more about AI, GitHub Copilot, SQL Server, and other topics.
 
Another topic that we covered was the model evaluation sample, which is a work in progress that we are going to present at Build 2024.  (you can check the PR here). The idea behind this sample is to help you evaluate different models that you may want to use or fine-tune for your own applications. We showed you how to use a console application that uses semantic kernel to generate questions and answers, user stories, and other inputs, and then evaluate them using different metrics, such as coherence, groundedness, relevance, and length.
 
The full recording is here,

Best,

Performance testing is not always a walk in the park. Quite often, it can be challenging and time-consuming, especially when dealing with complex and dynamic web applications that rely on JavaScript, AJAX, or other browser-side technologies.
For testing browser latencies under heavy load, JMeter has a built-in component called Web Driver Sampler, which allows testers to use Selenium WebDriver to simulate real browser actions and interactions with web elements. Web Driver Sampler can complement the HTTP Request Sampler, which sends HTTP requests to the server, by adding the browser-side perspective and measuring the rendering time, page load time, and user actions. By running JMeter scripts on Azure Load Testing, you can reliably execute your performance tests without worrying …]]></summary>

When writing that post with Harsha CS I had the chance to play a bit with VNet Flow Logs and Traffic Analytics, and I would like to share some of the learnings.
 
 
What the heck am I talking about? Let me bring you up to speed very quickly (attention, oversimplification ahead!): NSG Flow Logs is a technology that logs every packet going through an NSG: in and out, allowed and dropped. The main issue of NSG Flow Logs is, well, that you need an NSG, and some resources in Azure do not support them. For example, Azure Firewall, VPN gateways or ExpressRoute gateways. Enter VNet Flow Logs, which you can enable in a whole VNet or subnet, regardless of whether there…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
Containerization has become the prevailing choice for hosting and managing Java applications, due to its unmatched portability, consistency, and scalability benefits. However, by default, when running a Java app inside containers, the JVM assumes that the OS memory is shared among multiple applications, so it conservatively claims memory for the Java application.
With Azure Container Apps, we can optimize memory allocation by simply dedicating more memory to the Java app, since only one Java application can run inside a container. This feature is called automatic memory fit, which is enabled by default when you deploy from Java source code or artifact.
In this blog we’ll cover the following:

Redis is an extremely popular in-memory data store that is used as a cache, session store, message broker, and more. One of the features that makes Redis really useful is the ability to set a time-to-live (TTL) value for any key. A key with a TTL value will be automatically deleted from Redis when the TTL expires. This helps reduce memory usage and ensure data freshness.
 
For instance, you might be storing information like inventory or pricing for your e-commerce site in Redis. This is a perfect application for caching in Redis. This type of data will be queried constantly and serving it directly from a database will either slow down your application or make your database implementation very expensive to handle the load!

A custom claims provider is made up of a custom authentication extension that calls an external REST API (e.g., a Function App), to fetch claims from external systems (e.g., a Database). A custom claims provider can be assigned to one or many applications.
 
Claim: Please imagine it as features (or attributes) that belong to the end user. As it may involve sensitive information within the enterprise, the enterprise owner wishes to store this user information in the on-premises environment, while also hoping to retrieve and utilize it through the authentication process.

In this article we will focus on scaling azure web apps and how the new automatic scaling feature of azure app service, which allows it to scale out and in, in response to HTTP web traffic against your web app is a great feature which further enhances cost savings and improves the availability and resiliency of your web application under conditions of load.
We will also try to understand how automatic scaling is different (and at times based on scenarios better) than rule scaling, how to better understand and configure scaling limits and how it impacts scaling of different web applications sharing the same app service plan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Azure Monitor and App Service teams are happy to share that Application Insights integration with App Services for Python apps is now available for Public Preview. You can now easily monitor your Python apps on App Service without changing your code by leveraging auto-instrumentation that is integrated into the App Services platform.
 
This integration supports App Service deploy as code for Python versions 3.11 and lower. Deploy as container scenarios are not currently supported, but we plan to introduce this capability at a future date. We also plan to support Python 3.12 in the near future.
 
With this feature enabled, the App Service platform will instrument popular Python libraries in your code and automatically channel correlated application-level logs, metrics, and distributed tracing to your Application Insights resource. This will allow you to understand how your Python application is performing and more easily determine the cause of any incidents.
 
You can enable the feature at resource creation or from the App Insights blade after your App Service resource is created. Please review our documentation to learn more.
 
Turn On App Insights during App Service Resource Creation
 
When you create a new Python web application (version 3.11 and lower) using the "Deploy as code" option, you can select "Yes" on the "Enable Application Insights" in the "Monitoring" tab. If you select "Yes", then your non-containerized Python application will pipe data to an Application Insights resource allowing you to automatically monitor your workloads.
 

 
 
Turn On App Insights after App Service Resource Creation
 
Open your App Service application in the portal and go to the App Insights menu item.

Select "Enable" in the toggle under "Application Insights (Preview)"
Select a location for your Application Insights resource (It’s suggested to create the resource in the same region as the Web App.)]]></summary>

ISVs often face challenges in managing data for multiple tenants in a secure manner while keeping costs low. Traditional solutions may prove costly for scenarios with more than 100 tenants, especially with the common ISV scenario where the volume of trial and free tenants is much larger than the volume of paying tenants.
The motivation for ISVs to use Fabric is that it brings together experiences such as Data Engineering, Data Factory, Data Science, Data Warehouse, Real-Time Analytics, and Power BI onto a shared SaaS foundation.
In this article, we will explore the Workspace per tenant-based architecture, which is a cost-effective solution for managing data for all tenants in Microsoft Fabric, including ETL and reporting.

Our host, David Blank-Edelman and our armchair architects Uli Homann and Eric Charran will be discussing how to choose a Large Language Model (LLM) partner.  Architects and developers are often at a crossroads: should they use existing AI models or venture into building their own? This decision is far from trivial, as it comes with a myriad of considerations, from return on investment to the rapid pace of AI commoditization.
 
What are the processes and criteria you should consider when choosing a LLM or a foundational model (FM) for your AI project, and are the trade-offs between building your own model or using a hosted service? What are some of the challenges of trusting and validating the outputs of LLMs and FMs?  When choosing an LLM partner, what things should you think …]]></summary>

One of the ways to optimize cost and performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is to cache the responses from LLMs, this is sometimes referred to as “semantic caching”. In this blog, we will discuss the approaches, benefits, common scenarios and key considerations for using semantic caching.
 
What is semantic caching?
Caching systems typically store commonly retrieved data for subsequent serving in an optimal manner. In the context of LLMs, semantic cache maintains a cache of previously asked questions and responses, uses similarity measures to retrieve semantically similar queries from the cache and respond with cached responses if a match is found within the threshold for similarity. If cache is not able to return a response, then the answer can be returned from a fresh L…]]></summary>

We did mention the /optimize command, amongst many others. In the new short video I just posted, my colleague Bruno Capuano is with us again, and showing a demo of the /optimize command, and how he uses it to refactor a piece of code.
 



 
Refactoring with GitHub Copilot
In the example, Bruno takes classic "for" loop using a numerical index and refactors it to use a "foreach" loop. In general, I also prefer to use "foreach" loops in .NET as I feel that they are more readable than the more classic "for" syntax. That being said, the "for" syntax is usually faster, so use this wisely!

This article is to inform you of some important changes that we are making as part of our ongoing efforts to improve your Azure experience and increase pricing transparency. We are making changes to the billing meters that could affect some Azure services and resources that you may use, and we want to make sure you understand what the changes are, why we are doing them, and how they will impact your billing. 
 
These updates will not impact your prices, but you may notice some changes in how your Azure consumption is shown on your invoice, price sheet, API, and other Cost Management tools.

Two key concepts that are typically either planned late or addressed reactively in transformation projects are: 1. Cutover strategy, and 2. Planning the migration of middleware while also reusing the middleware solutions for both one-time migrations and for near-real-time integrations. Having these plans in place makes the changeover more seamless, with little or no impact on the systems’ functioning taking into consideration the time period between the end of the on-premises (or legacy) system and the beginning of the cloud (or modern) system.

In previous posts I shared how to host and chat with a Llama 2 model hosted locally with Ollama. (view post). And then, it was time to learn how to integrate Semantic Kernel with OllamaSharp (nuget package and repo).
 
OllamaSharp is a .NET binding for the Ollama API, making it easy to interact with Ollama using your favorite .NET languages.
 
So, I decided to try it, and create a Chat Completion and a Text Generation specific implementation for Semantic Kernel using this library.
The full test is a console app using both services with Semantic Kernel.
 

Text Generation Service
The Text Generation Service is an easy one. Just implement the interface Microsoft.SemanticKernel.TextGeneration.ITextGenerationService, and the generated code looks like this:

Over the years, Azure Cloud Services (classic) has played a central role in Microsoft’s cloud offerings. However, as technology advances, there arises a demand for more sophisticated and efficient services. To address this, Microsoft has introduced Azure Cloud Services (extended support) as a successor to the classic model. It provides comparable functionality while adding extra benefits and features. This transition is essential for businesses to remain current with technology, enhance their cloud management capabilities, and be well-prepared for the future.
Cloud Services (extended support) is a highly anticipated and essential platform enhancement for Azure early adopter customers who are transitioning to Azure Resource Manager (ARM).

They used to have multiple reporting/analytics platforms like QlikView, Tableau & Power BI, but consolidating them on one platform has made operations & management easier. This architecture has also led to performance challenges and rising costs of Snowflake and Power BI and also prohibited them from implementing Self Data Service.  Customers are looking to reduce costs for Power BI and Snowflake and solve some of the architectural issues in offering self-data service for business users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Effective cost management in Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics is essential for controlling cloud expenditures. It involves strategic measures to reduce costs while maximizing the value derived from ingested, processed, and retained data. In Azure, achieving this balance entails adopting efficient data ingestion methods, smart retention policies, and judicious use of table transformations with Kusto Query Language (KQL).
Understanding the impact of data management practices on costs is crucial since each byte of data ingested and stored in Azure Log Analytics incurs expenses. Table transformations—such as filtering, projecting, aggregating, sorting, joining, and dropping data—are a great way to reduce storage and ingestion costs.  They allow you to filter or modify data before it’s sen…]]></summary>

This solution guide presents a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models, such as ChatGPT, to address the limitations found in traditional recommendation methods. Traditional methods are typically task-specific and therefore require corresponding data to train distinct models for various applications. These methods often lack generalization capabilities and underperform in cold start situations. To overcome these challenges, we propose and implement an ecommerce recommender system based on ChatGPT. This system is specifically designed for recommendation systems in scenarios with limited task-specific data, for example, cold start problem that often associates with new users. The "cold start problem" is a term commonly used in the context of recommendatio…]]></summary>

This is still the plan, and in this post, we wanted to discuss a bit more about how things will work once the option is available.
 
How the in-process model option for .NET 8 will work

Built-in policy definitions usually cover a specific scenario although some flexibility might be provided through parameters that can be configured. However, customers might have specific needs not covered by an available built-in policy definition and a custom policy definition might be needed.
 
As a rule of thumb, if there is a built-in policy definition that covers part of a scenario, a custom policy definition can be created based on it introducing the necessary modifications.
 
Let’s take into consideration the [Preview]: Assign Built-In User-Assigned Managed Identity to Virtual Machines built-in policy definition that creates and assigns a built-in user-assigned managed identity or assigns a pre-created user-assigned managed identity at scale to virtual machines. This currently provides the user-assigned managed identity name and resource group name as parameters expecting that it is on the same subscription as the virtual machine resource. However, in a scenario where the pre-created user-assigned managed identity exists in a different subscription from the virtual machine resource, a custom policy definition is required.
 
Before creating a custom policy, it is worth checking both the Azure Policy Samples as well as the Community Policy Repository to see whether a policy definition that matches your needs already exists. Coming back to the user-assigned managed identity assignment to virtual machines where the pre-created user-assigned managed identity exists in a different subscription from the virtual machine resource scenario, a custom policy definition is available here where the user assigned managed identity resource URI (which contains the subscription ID) is provided as a parameter.]]></summary>

In this new series of content, we will show you how GitHub Copilot works in Visual Studio specifically and how it helps you being more productive. 
In the first short video in this series, my colleague Bruno Capuano shows you how you can install GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat for Visual Studio.
 



 
Understanding the difference between GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat
 
GitHub Copilot works directly in your code files by suggesting completions for your code. It works in a similar manner as Intellisense does, but is able to propose whole blocks of code based on what you are typing. It also provides acce…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the previous post, you developed an image similarity search app using Jupyter Notebook. Utilizing the pgvector extension on Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL, you were able to detect images that are semantically similar to a reference image or a text prompt.
 
By default, pgvector performs exact nearest neighbor search, calculating the similarity between the query vector and every vector in the database. While this type of search provides perfect recall, it often leads to longer search times. To enhance efficiency for large datasets, you should create indexes to enable approximate nearest neighbor search, which trades off result quality for speed. Pgvector supports two types of approximate indexes:

        <updated>2024-03-19T00:52:08.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft is looking to enable TLS 1.3 for Azure Service Bus, and Azure Event Hubs.  We found however that there is a problem with some clients that use both Java and our AMQP or JMS interfaces.  Java clients that use Apache Proton-J with a version older than proton-j-0.31.0 along with Java 11+ can't support TLS 1.3.  The Proton-J library is used in AMQP and JMS implementations. The nature of the problem lies in the handshake and is thus not detectable by our application layer.  This means that we can't detect and work around the issue from the service side.  To avoid this problem, customers need to update any instances of Apache Proton-J that have a version older than proton-j-0.31.0.  The link for the Proton-J issue is tracked at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PROTON-1972
 
Required action
Proton-J may also be in a dependent library and may not be directly used by your code. To determine if you have an incompatibility with TLS 1.3, we have enabled the West Central US region with TLS 1.3 support for AMQP traffic.  To test if you have a compatibility issue

first evaluate if you are using AMQP or JMS
Second, determine if you are using Java 11+ with your client code
Third, if you are using AMQP or JMS and also Java 11+, then create a namespace in West Central US and attempt to connect to it with your code. 

If your client fails to connect, you need to find where you are using Proton-J and get the version used updated to a version that is newer than proton-j-0.30.0.
 
Timeline
As already noted, this only affects AMQP or JMS traffic.  It does not affect web service or Kafka traffic which does have TLS 1.3 enabled now.  We are going to enable TLS 1.3 for AMQP and JMS on October 31, 2024.  That is also the same day that TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 is being removed from Azure Event Hubs and Azure Service Bus.  Please take action as soon as possible to guarantee no interruption to your service use when we enable TLS 1.3.]]></summary>

The infrastructure layer of Azure Event Hubs is being upgraded which will cause the IP addresses used by customer namespaces to change. These changes are being made as part of our continuous improvements to our platform. The IP addresses of our services can change and should not be considered static and unchanging. The changes being made will not alter billing or cause any service interruptions.  
 
Call to Action 
If you are using IP addresses in your egress firewalls to your Azure Event Hubs namespaces, you will need to configure your firewalls to use the fully qualified domain names for your specific namespaces, or the wildcard “*.servicebus.windows.net” domains.

PII can pose risks to both the data subjects and the data holders and can introduce security breach vulnerability, privacy violations or biases that affect the decisions made based on the data. For example, if a source data contains PII in a generative AI application, there's a risk of confidential information such as a bank account information to be returned from a user's prompt inquiry.  One way to protect PII is to use responsible AI, which is a set of principles and practices that help to mask PII with synthetic or anonymized data …]]></summary>

In that post, I focused on evaluating a model’s answers for a set of questions that could be answered by the data. But what about all those questions that can’t be answered by the data? Does your model know how to say “I don’t know?” LLMs are very eager-to-please, so it actually takes a fair bit of prompt engineering to persuade them to answer in the negative, especially for answers in their weights somewhere.

Azure Container Apps (ACA) provides a flexible and scalable platform for deploying containerized applications. One powerful feature it offers is the ability to customize startup commands and override default CMD or ENTRYPOINT defined in a Dockerfile. In this blog, we'll explore how to leverage the "Command Override" option using various methods in ACA and Container App Jobs.
 
Understanding Command Overrides
Command overrides come in handy when you need to execute specific CMD or change the ENTRYPOINT of your container at runtime.
 
Example:
If one wants to run "index.js" during the start of the app, but as per line number 14 in below image, the "server.js" file will execute.

It can be achieved by providing "node", "index.js" to Command Override field in ACA, in easy words, t…]]></summary>

We write tests, like unit tests, integration tests, smoke tests, accessibility tests, loadtests, property-based tests. We can’t automate all forms of testing, so we test what we can, and hire humans to audit what we can’t.
 
But when we’re building RAG chat apps built on LLMs, we need to introduce an entirely new form of testing to give us confidence that our LLM responses are coherent, grounded, and well-formed.
 
We call this form of testing “evaluation”, and we can now automate it with the help of the most powerful LLM in town: GPT-4.

As an architect Eric worries about a couple main areas in the AI space. First there are ethical and responsible considerations for architects integrating LLMs into any type of design, collaboration, or application experience.

This process involves different knowledge areas, and Azure OpenAI Service brings very powerful model choices to enterprises, such as gpt-3.5-turbo-16k, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-4-turbo-32k, gpt-4-vision wait. However, for some special industries and traditional enterprises, they prefer to train their own industry models based on their own underlying structures or applications combined with their own data.

JavaScript, the powerhouse behind many applications, sometimes faces limitations when it comes to memory in a Node.js environment.  Today, let's dive into a common challenge faced by many applications - the default memory limit in Node.js. In this blog post, we'll explore how to break free from these limitations, boost your application's performance, and optimize memory usage.
 

 
Understanding the Challenge:
 
Node.js applications are confined by a default memory limit set by the runtime environment. This can be a bottleneck for memory-intensive applications. Fortunately, Node.js provides a solution by allowing developers to increase this fixed memory limit, paving the way for improved performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a popular technique to get LLMs to provide answers that are grounded in a data source. When we use RAG, we use the user's question to search a knowledge base (like Azure AI Search), then pass along both the question and the relevant content to the LLM (gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4), with a directive to answer only according to the sources. In psuedo-code:
 
user_query = "what's in the Northwind Plus plan?"
user_query_vector = create_embedding(user_query, "ada-002")
results = search(user_query, user_query_vector)
response = create_chat_completion(system_prompt, user_query, results)

The app receives a user question, uses the user question to search a knowledge base, then sends the question and matching bits of information to the LLM, instructing the LLM to adhere to the sources.
 
That's the most straightforward RAG approach, but as it turns out, it's not what quite what we do in our most popular open-source RAG solution, azure-search-openai-demo.
 
The flow instead looks like this:

After the app receives a user question, it makes an initial call to an LLM to turn that user question into a more appropriate search query for Azure AI search. More generally, you can think of this step as turning the user query into a datastore-aware query. This a…]]></summary>

The count of records in the indexer and the index did not align even after activating the change detection policy. Even with record deletions, the entries persisted in the Index Search Explorer.
 
To enable incremental indexing, configure the "dataChangeDetectionPolicy" property within your data source definition. This setting informs the indexer about the specific change tracking mechanism employed by your table or view.
 
For Azure SQL indexers, you can choose the change detection policy below:
"SqlIntegratedChangeTrackingPolicy" (applicable to tables exclusively)

By default, HTTP apps in Azure Container Apps are accessible via a public URL that is unique to the app. However, you can create a container app to use a reverse proxy like NGINX to control how traffic is routed to multiple apps based on the path or hostname.
 
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use Azure Container Apps to configure path and hostname-based routing for a set of containerized applications using NGINX as a reverse proxy. You'll deploy 4 applications: 1 NGINX container which will be publicly exposed and 3 container apps which will only be accessible from within the environment and that traffic will…]]></summary>

Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker that allows you to connect, decouple, and exchange messages between different applications and services. It supports a range of communication patterns, such as queues, topics, and event hubs, and enables reliable and secure message delivery at scale.
However, to ensure that your Azure Service Bus solution can handle the expected load and performance requirements, you need to conduct load testing and measure the throughput, latency, and resource utilization of your system under various scenarios. Load testing can help you identify and resolve any bottlenecks, errors, or failures that might occur when your system is under stress.

Today, we launched our refreshed guidance for identity and access management (IAM) in Azure Landing Zones. ALZ is a core part of the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure. It is aligned to the eight CAF design areas, Identity and Access Management being one of them. You can check out the refreshed guidance over at: aka.ms/ALZ/IAM
 
The updated guidance brings IAM to the heart of a robust Azure Landing Zones implementation. ALZ is built to support a Zero Trust strategy, and the guidance is centred around the principle of least privilege to ensure that every administrator and user has the access they need, when they need it, to the right resources, and nothing more.

The infrastructure layer of Azure Relay and Service Bus is being upgraded which will cause the IP addresses used by customer namespaces to. For Azure Relay the gateway DNS names are also changing.
 
These changes are being made as part of our continuous improvements to our platform. The IP addresses of our services can change and should not be considered static and unchanging as previously communicated in the communication for Azure Service Bus and Azure Relay.  There is no added charge for this nor are there any service interruptions during the migration.
 
Call to Action 
If you are using IP addresses in your egress firewalls to your Azure Relay or Azure Service Bus namespaces, you will need to update them to use the namespace DNS names instead.

For Azure Service Bus, configure your firewalls to use the fully qualified domain names for your specific namespaces, or the wildcard “*.servicebus.windows.net” domains. These will automatically resolve to the new IP addresses.
 
Azure Relay customers
For Azure Relay, configure your firewalls with the DNS names of all the Relay gateways, which can be found by running this script . This script will resolve the fully qualified domain names of all the gateways to which you need to establish a connection.
Change any rules that previously used the IP addresses to use the namespace DNS name for port 80/443 traffic and the gateway DNS names where you previously were using IP addresses.  WCF uses a number of ports beyond 80/443 including 9351, 9350, 5671, 9352, and 9353 so be sure to check, where you have firewall rules for those ports.]]></summary>

Eric defines vector databases as a way in which we store meaningful information about multi-dimensional aspects of data such as what's called vectors, which are numerical, typically numerical integers which work very much like a traditional relational database system.
 
What's interesting about the vector databases is that they help us solve different types of queries. One type of query is like a “nearest neighbor”.

For example,

Sales Channel

Country
Unit Price

It is a good practice to replace all the spaces in a column name before doing any transformation for easy handling. This also helps with auto mapping, when the sink column names do not come with spaces!
 
Select transformation in data flow makes it simpler to automatically detect spaces in column names and then remove them for the rest of the dataflow.
 
Consider the below source, with the given column names.
 

 
Here as we can see, few columns have spaces, few columns like Region and Country do not have spaces in it. 
 
Using the below configuration in select transformation, we can get rid of the spaces in the column names with a simple expression. 
 
In the Input columns, Click on Add mapping button, and choose Rule-based Mapping.

Then give the below expression:
on Source1's column: true()
on Name as column: replace($$,' ','')
 

What it does? 
It will return true() for all the columns which have ' ' (space) in it and replace it with '' (no space).
Upon data preview, we get to see the below result,
 

 
As we are seeing here, all the columns with spaces are coming without spaces in between. 
If not for the Rule based mapping, one would have to manually remove space from all the columns. It would be a nightmare if the number of columns are more! Thanks to rule-based mapping!]]></summary>

How do you manage the lifecycle of those APIs?
What governance would you apply to these APIs?
What is the list of environments needed to manage these APIs?
What are the deployment strategies for those APIs?
How would you integrate those APIs with other services?

 
As your company's number of APIs increases, so does the complexity of managing them. Azure API Center (APIC) is a central repository for your APIs lifecycle management, and it offers the more efficient ways for management.

For different scenarios and workflows, powerful tools need to be assembled to support the operation of the AI agent. If you only use your own tool chain in the AI agent framework to solve enterprise workflow, it will be very limited. AutoGen supports defining tool chains through Function Calling, and developers can define different methods to assemble extended business work chains. As mentioned before, Semantic Kernel has good business-based plug-in creation, management and engineering capabilities. Through AutoGen + Semantic Kernel, powerful AI agent solutions can be built.

A content website generally involves 2 artifacts: the website code itself, and the articles that make up the website content. To build such websites, content management systems (CMS) are ideal tools to provide purpose-built editing experiences for content editors.
 
Traditional CMS's such as WordPress provide both the ability to edit content and the website code itself. They provide a…]]></summary>

The goal of this post is to show some strategies that can be used to convert AWS Lambda Functions into Azure Functions using LLMs.
 
Disclaimer: This article is an experimental implementation about applying LLMs to convert AWS Lambda functions into Azure Functions. It is not intended as a defined guide for the process and does not guarantee successful conversion. The outcome depends on the specific code you intend to convert and the LLM that you are using.

What would it take to convert a Lambda Function into an Azure Function?
 
There are a few things that we need to take into account with Lambda Functions:

It’s time to go back to AI and NET, so today’s post is a small demo on how to run a LLM (large language model, this demo using Phi-2) in local mode, and how to interact with the model using Semantic Kernel.
 
LM Studio
I’ve tested several products and libraries to run LLMs locally, and LM Studio is on my top 3. LM Studio is a desktop application that allows you to run open-source models locally on your computer. You can use LM Studio to discover, download, and chat with models from Hugging Face, or create your own custom models. LM Studio also lets you run a local inference server that mimics the OpenAI API, so you can use any model with your favourite tools and frameworks. LM Studio is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux, and you can download it from their website.
