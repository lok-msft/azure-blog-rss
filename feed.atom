        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past few months, we gradually rolled out the new Log Analytics experience to our users. The feedback has been positive, and the telemetry shows that users are more successful at working with their data. Today, we’re excited to announce that the new Log Analytics experience, including Simple Mode and other improvements, is now fully available and enabled by default. 
How simple is it? Here are two quick examples: 
Investigate Workspace Usage: 

Double-click the Usage table to load the latest data. 
Add an Aggregate operation to sum the Quantity column by DataType.
Add a Sort operation by Quantity, and instantly see the results organized. 
At the top-right, click the three dots and create a New Alert Rule. 


 
Troubleshoot Kubernetes Pods: 

Select the KubePodInventory table and click Run to view the latest data. 
Filter the PodStatus column to Pending. 
Add an Aggregate operator to count the failed pods by Name. 
Click Share and export the results to CSV.  


That’s it - just a few clicks, and you’ve gained meaningful insights!  
Seamless Transition for Advanced Users 
If you’re comfortable with Kusto Query Language (KQL), you can switch to KQL Mode, edit the auto-generated query, and dive deeper. Once done, you can switch back to Simple Mode to continue exploring with updated results. You can also set your preferred default mode through the Settings menu for a customized experience. 
Improved Usability
The interface includes organized menus for key actions like Save, Share, and Export, and a collapsible pane for quick access to tables, saved queries, examples, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI Toolkit is a VS Code extension aiming to empower AI engineers in transforming their curiosity into advanced generative AI applications. This toolkit, featuring both local-enabled and cloud-accelerated inner loop capabilities, is set to ease model exploration, prompt engineering, and the creation and evaluation of generative applications. We are pleased to announce the January Update to the toolkit with support for OpenAI's o1 model and enhancements in the Model Playground and Bulk Run features.
What's New?
January’s update brings several exciting new features to boost your productivity in AI development. Here's a closer look at what's included:

Support for OpenAI’s new o1 Model: We've added access to GitHub hosted OpenAI’s latest o1 model. This new model replaces the o1-preview and offers even better performance in handling complex tasks. You can start interacting with the o1 model within VS Code for free by using the latest AI Toolkit update.
Chat History Support in Model Playground: We have heard your feedback that tracking past model interactions is crucial. The Model Playground has been updated to include support for chat history. This feature saves chat history as individual files stored entirely on your local machine, ensuring privacy and security.
Bulk Run with Prompt Templating: The Bulk Run feature, introduced in the AI Toolkit December release, now supports prompt templating with variables. This allows users to create templates for prompts, insert variables, and run them in bulk. This enhancement simplifies the process of testing multiple scenarios and models.

Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements as we continue to innovate and support your journey in AI development.

What's New?
January’s update brings several exciting new features to boost your productivity in AI development. Here's a closer look at what's included:

Support for OpenAI’s new o1 Model: We've added access to GitHub hosted OpenAI’s latest o1 model. This new model replaces the o1-preview and offers even better performance in handling complex tasks. You can start interacting with the o1 model within VS Code for free by using the latest AI Toolkit update.
Chat History Support in Model Playground: We have heard your feedback that tracking past model interactions is crucial. The Model Playground has been updated to include support for chat history. This feature saves chat history as individual files stored entirely on your local machine, ensuring privacy and security.
Bulk Run with Prompt Templating: The Bulk Run feature, introduced in the AI Toolkit December release, now supports prompt templating with variables. This allows users to create templates for prompts, insert variables, and run them in bulk. This enhancement simplifies the process of testing multiple scenarios and models.

Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements as we continue to innovate and support your journey in AI development. Try out the AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code, share your thoughts, and file issues and suggest features in our GitHub repo. Thank you for being a part of this journey with us!]]></summary>

If you’re using VS code and you’re not using GitHub Copilot yet, you should definitely check it out. GitHub Copilot is your AI pair programmer tool in Visual Studio Code. Get code suggestions as you type or use Inline Chat in the editor to write code faster. Add new functionality or resolve bugs across your project with Copilot Edits, or use natural language in chat to explore your codebase. Also calling out that you can definitely do what we’ll be doing in this blog post without GitHub Copilot and instead use a different Copilot implementation or other AI tool altogether, but using GitHub Copilot directly where you’re writing your code and building your ARM/Bicep templates is a great way to make your process quicker and more efficient.]]></summary>

Why Scalable and Efficient Fine-Tuning Matters
Faster Iterations, Shorter Time-to-Value:
In today’s competitive AI landscape, time is of the essence. The faster you can fine-tune a model, the quicker you can validate ideas, test hypotheses, and bring solutions to market.
High-profile GPU machines are costly:
High-performance GPUs and compute clusters don’t come cheap, and their availability is often limited. Efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as model sharding and distributed training, maximize the utilization of these precious resources—ensuring that you get the most out of your infrastructure investment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem Domain
As usage of Azure DevOps organisations grow so do the number of projects, repositories, pipelines and agent pools used. With new services available such as Managed DevOps Pools it can appear a mammoth task for central IT function to manually trawl through every pipeline noting down each agentpool being used. Replacing these values potentially even more complicated after creating the new agent pools and mapping them with potential for human error.
Solution
As there is no built in reporting for this at the moment I have built a bespoke bash script that can be ran to generate a report and optionally replace the values in each pipeline for a new agentpool.

In this blog post I document my experience of spending a full day using KAITO and Copilot to accelerate deployment and development of a self managed AI enabled chatbot deployed in a managed cluster. The goal is to showcase how quickly using a mix of AI tooling we can go from zero to a self hosted, tuned LLM and chatbot application. 
At the top of this article I want to share my perspective on the future of projects such as KAITO. At the moment I believe KAITO to be somewhat ahead of its time, as most enterprises begin adopting abstracted artificial intelligence it is brilliant to see projects like KAITO being developed ready for the eventual abstraction pendulum to swing back, motivated by usual factors such as increased skills in the market, cost and governance.

It allows them to select the configuration that best meets their requirements without investing significantly in physical hardware. VMs provide flexibility and scalability, which can be particularly advantageous for developers, machine learning engineers, and data scientists. They often need to use Docker for their projects, a process known as Nested Virtualization.
Nested virtualization is a feature that enables running Hyper-V inside a Hyper-V virtual machine (VM). Over time, hardware has improved, and the use cases for Nested Virtualization have increased. For instance, Nested Virtualization can be useful for:

GitHub Copilot es un asistente de programación impulsado por Inteligencia Artificial (IA) que puede ejecutarse en varios entornos, ayudándote a ser más eficiente en tus tareas diarias de programación. En este blog, te mostraremos específicamente cómo funciona GitHub Copilot en Visual Studio y cómo puede aumentar tu productividad.
Comprendiendo la diferencia entre GitHub Copilot y GitHub Copilot Chat:
GitHub Copilot funciona directamente en tus archivos de código, proporcionando sugerencias para tu código. Funciona de manera similar a IntelliSense, pero es capaz de proponer bloques completos de código en base a lo que estás escribiendo. También proporciona acceso a comandos, puede explicar el código y ofrecer funciones adicionales directamente respecto a tus archivos.
GitHub Copilot Chat funciona en una ventana independiente dentro del entorno de Visual Studio. Proporciona un asistente de chat que puede recordar el contexto de la conversación y ofrecer sugerencias inteligentes.
Ambas extensiones se pueden instalar por separado. Te recomendamos probar ambas para que puedas elegir la que prefieras. En próximas oportunidades, te mostraremos más detalles sobre cada una de estas extensiones.
Instalando las extensiones de GitHub Copilot
Ambas extensiones se pueden instalar directamente desde Visual Studio, a través del menú Extensiones / Administrar extensiones. Desde allí, busca GitHub Copilot y GitHub Copilot Chat.

También puedes dirigirte a Visual Studio Marketplace, que contiene una gran cantidad de extensiones para mejorar tu experiencia con Visual Studio.
Ten en cuenta que GitHub Copilot requiere Visual Studio 2022 17.5.5 o posterior.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, viewing your Java or Java WebServer version on Linux is typically a two-step process involving first creating a remote connection, and then connecting to the remote connection to view your web app's info. Note that these steps do NOT work on App Service Windows applications, this applies only to App Service Linux.
Viewing your minor and patch version on App Service Linux for Java applications is possible by first setting up a remote connection to your Linux webapp by running the following command:
az webapp create-remote-connection -g {RESOURCE_GROUP} -n {WEBAPP_NAME}
This will result in something like this:

After creating the remote connection, we can connect to the webapp and view the info we’re looking for. Using another terminal window, to connect to our remote connection run the following command:
ssh root@127.0.0.1 -m hmac-sha1 -p {PORT_NUMBER}
After entering the password shown in the previous step, we will now have shell access to the web app. Now we can view our Java and webserver version.
To view Java version:
java -version
To view Tomcat version:
sh /usr/local/tomcat/version.sh
If your Tomcat Webserver is in a different location, we can locate it by running:
find / -name "version.sh"
To connect and view Java version with one command:
ssh root@127.0.0.1 -m hmac-sha1 -p {PORT_NUMBER} /usr/lib/jdk/bin/java -version
To connect and view Tomcat version with one command:
ssh root@127.0.0.1 -m hmac-sha1 -p {PORT_NUMBER} sh /usr/local/tomcat/version.sh]]></summary>

Sometimes it is useful to call APIs hosted in Azure App Service that has been configured to use Easy Auth.
By default Easy Auth allows the web application itself to be authenticated in a browser. This redirects to Microsoft Entra to then allow the user to enter their credentials. The application is then authenticated and any APIs hosted in the App Service can then be used.
Sometimes it may be useful to call these APIs programmatically from code, VS Code or Postman. This opens up the possibility of driving the APIs hosted in App Service programmatically. This can be very useful for testing generative AI solution accelerators automatically.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
Say goodbye to constantly running Spark clusters! With the shared metadata functionality, you can shut down your Spark pools while still be able to query your Spark external tables using Serverless SQL Pool.
In this blog we dive into, how Serverless SQL Pool streamlines your data workflow by automatically synchronizing metadata from your Spark pools.
Shared Metadata functionality
Azure Synapse Analytics allows the different workspace computational engines to share databases and tables between its Apache Spark pools and serverless SQL pool.
When we create tables in Apache Spark Pool, whether managed or external, the Serverless SQL pool automatically synchronizes its metadata. This metadata synchronization automatically creates a corresponding external table in a serverless SQL pool database. Then after a short delay, we can see the table in our Serverless SQL pool.
Creating a managed table in Spark and querying from Serverless SQL Pool

Now we can shut down our Spark pools and still be able to query Spark external tables from Serverless SQL Pool.


NOTE: Azure Synapse currently only shares managed and external Spark tables that store their data in Parquet, DELTA, or CSV format. Tables backed by other formats are not automatically synced. 
You may be able to sync such tables explicitly yourself as an external table in your own SQL database if the SQL engine supports the table's underlying format.
Also, External tables created in Spark are not available in dedicated SQL pool databases.

Why we get an error if you use dbo schema in Spark pool or if you don’t use dbo schema in Serverless SQL pool?
The dbo schema (short for “database owner”) is the default schema in SQL Server and Azure Synapse SQL pools.
Spark pool only supports user-defined schemas. Means, it does not recognize dbo as a valid schema name. While in Serverless SQL Pool, all the tables belong to the dbo schema, regardless of their original schema in Spark pool or other sources.]]></summary>

Introduction
When using the Graph API to manage mail-related services, setting the permission to Delegate permission restricts the authorization to the user’s identity, limiting management to the specific user’s mailbox. While this might not be sufficient for certain business scenarios, Application permission, on the other hand, allows authorization under the App’s identity, enabling access to all users’ mailboxes within the tenant, which could be overly broad for certain use cases.
Therefore, a method is required that allows the management of a specific mailbox using the App’s identity.
This scenario is not recommended to use Delegate permission and requires some prerequisites, which are …]]></summary>

Granting list-only permissions to specific users for an Azure Storage container path allows them to list files and directories without reading or downloading their contents. While RBAC manages access at the container or account level, ABAC offers more granular control by leveraging attributes like resource metadata, user roles, or environmental factors, enabling customized access policies to meet specific requirements.

A key component in Arabic TTS is the diacritic model, which represents a challenging task. In written Arabic, diacritics, which indicate vowel sounds, are typically omitted. The diacritic task involves predicting the diacritic for each Arabic character in the written form. We enhanced diacritic prediction by utilizing a base model pre-trained with Machine Translation and other NLP tasks, then fine-tuning it on a comprehensive diacritics' corpus. This approach reduced word-level pronunciation errors by 78%.
Additionally, we improved the reading of English words in Arabic texts. For English words transcribed using the Arabic alphabet, they can now be read as standard English.

Introduction
In late 2024, Microsoft Entra enforced MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for all user login processes. This change has caused some Web Apps using delegated permissions to fail in acquiring access tokens, thereby interrupting communication with O365 resources. This tutorial will present various alternative solutions tailored to different business requirements.

The assets of a bank are only accessible to some high-ranking officials, and even they don't have access to individual user lockers. These privacy features help build trust among customers. The same goes with in our IT world. Every user wants their sensitive data to be accessible only to themselves, not even available to those with higher privileges within the company. So, as you move data to the cloud, securing the data assets is critical to building trust with your customers and partners.
To enable these kinds of preventions, Azure Synapse supports a wide range of advanced access control features to control who can access what data. These features are:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 dominate headlines with their extensive capabilities, they often come at the cost of high computational requirements and complexity. For developers and organizations looking to implement AI solutions on edge devices or with limited resources, Small Language Models (SLMs) are emerging as a practical alternative.
SLMs are not just "smaller" versions of their larger counterparts—they're designed to be faster, more efficient, and adaptable for specific tasks. With fewer parameters and lower computational needs, SLMs open the door to deploying AI on mobile devices, IoT systems, and edge environments without compromising performance.

In many enterprise environments, it's common for organizations to have multiple Azure tenants, each serving different teams, projects, or departments. While this segregation adds a layer of security and control, it can also introduce challenges, especially when resources need to interact across these tenants. 
 
One common scenario is when developers need their Azure Container App in one tenant to pull container images from an Azure Container Registry (ACR) located in another tenant. This is particularly useful for organizations that centralize their container images in a shared registry, perhaps managed by a DevOps team, while allowing individual teams from different tenants to deploy applications using those images. So let’s dive into how you can set this up seamlessly.

This is part of Microsoft’s Secure Future Initiative (SFI) to give organizations the tools they need in the current threat landscape. We’ll begin turning off legacy tokens in February 2025. Publishers and developers are actively migrating their Outlook add-ins to use Entra ID tokens through nested app authentication (NAA) and Microsoft Graph instead of legacy tokens.

This is where “fire-and-forget” methods come into play. In C#, a fire-and-forget method allows you to run a task without awaiting its completion.
A common use case is sending a confirmation email after creating a user, but this also brings some limitations, particularly when dealing with scoped services. In this blog, we’ll walk through an example and explain why scoped services, like database contexts or HTTP clients, cannot be accessed in fire-and-forget methods.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today at Ignite, we are thrilled to announce the General Availability of Kubernetes Metadata and Logs Filtering in Azure Monitor – Container Insights! This enhancement brings additional Kubernetes metadata to the ContainerLogsV2 schema, including PodLabels, PodAnnotations, PodUid, Image, ImageID, ImageRepo, and ImageTag. Moreover, the new Logs Filtering feature allows for precise filtering of both workload and system pods/containers. These advancements not only provide users with richer context and enhanced visibility into their workloads but are crucial for customer troubleshooting as they provide deeper insights into the Kubernetes environment.
Key Features

Enhanced ContainerLogV2 schema with Kubernetes Metadata Fields: Detailed metadata fields enhance log analysis. These include “podLabels,” “podAnnotations,” “podUid,” “image,” “imageID,” “imageRepo,” and “imageTag.”
Customized Include List Configuration: Users can tailor metadata fields via ConfigMap. All fields are collected by default.
Enhanced ContainerLogV2 schema with Log Level: Assess application health with color-coded severity levels (e.g., CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING). Helps incident response and proactive monitoring.
Annotation Based Log Filtering for workloads: Efficient log filtering through podAnnotations. Focus on relevant information, optimizing costs and resource usage.
ConfigMap Based Log Filtering for platform logs (System Kubernetes Namespaces): Enables ability to configure log collection of specific pods within the system namespaces through ConfigMap.
Grafana Dashboard for Visualization: Leverage the power of Grafana Dashboard to visualize log levels, log volume, rate, records, and more. Empowers in-depth analysis and real-time monitoring. 


To learn more and enable this new feature, please visit our Kubernetes Metadata and Logs Filtering Documentation.

Diagnose and Solve Problems with Conversational Diagnostics
Conversational Diagnostics leverages natural language processing to help you troubleshoot and resolve issues with your AKS clusters more efficiently. By simply describing your problem in plain language, you can get targeted diagnostics and solutions, making it easier to maintain the health and performance of your AKS deployments.
In Azure Portal under the Diagnose and solve problems the GIF is demonstrating Conversational Diagnostics, which uses natural language, to diagnose problems with an AKS cluster related to CPU Pressure on the nodes.
Availability and Future Developments
Conversational Diagnostics (Public Preview) for AKS will be available as part of Ignite 2024. Shortly after, the AKS + Conversational Diagnostics (Public Preview) integration will expand to Copilot in Azure and GitHub Copilot via azure.
 
With the integration of Conversational Diagnostics into Copilot in Azure, you can now access powerful diagnostic tools from anywhere in Azure Portal allowing you to quickly identify and resolve issues without leaving your workflow, enhancing productivity, and reducing downtime.
 
The expansion of Conversational Diagnostics to GitHub Copilot means that developers can now benefit from advanced troubleshooting capabilities while writing code, providing near real-time diagnostics and suggestions to help catch and fix issues early in the development process.
 
Stay tuned for more updates and detailed demonstrations at Ignite 2024. We look forward to seeing how Conversational Diagnostics will transform the way you manage and troubleshoot your AKS clusters.

Innovations and cost optimization
When migrating to the cloud, the expenses incurred (cost) and the benefits accrued (value) are both important considerations. Balancing costs and value are crucial because it helps organizations make informed decisions that maximize their return on investment (ROI). Among other things, cost calculations may include impact due to loss of business from planned and malicious events. Value in the cloud comes from agility in deploying and scaling and from productivity gains due to innovative technologies and tools.
For optimal performance and return on your investment (ROI), the recommendation is to collocate all IT resources and data in Azure. O…]]></summary>

Like in previous years we are using the App Service Early Access feature to enable day-0 support on the platform across all public regions on Azure App Service for Windows. The early access release will be followed by additional deployments to fully integrate the new bits across our fleet, expecting to be fully done by the end of the week.
On Azure App Service for Linux, .NET 9 GA will be fully integrated on day-0 across all public regions without any additional deployments.
If you already have an app targeting an earlier preview of .NET 9.0 on the platform for App Service for Windows, you would need to redeploy the application after updating your runtimeconfig.json to use .NET 9.0.0.

LLM's have outdated knowledge and lack internal knowledge
Large Language Models like GPT-3, Llama are trained on vast datasets that include a wide range of publicly available texts. However, they have notable limitations:
 


Lack of Updated Knowledge: LLMs are only as current as the data they were trained on. For instance, if a model was trained on data up to October 2021, it wouldn't be aware of developments or facts that emerged after that date. This lack of temporal awareness makes them less effective for tasks requiring up-to-date information.


Outdated Public Knowledge: Even within the timeframe of their training data, LLMs may still rely on outdated or incorrect public information. This is because the data they are trained on reflects the knowledge available at the time…]]></summary>

Using Entity Framework Core offers several advantages:

No need to learn a new language; utilize C# and LINQ.
Tooling to maintain synchronization between C# models and database tables.
Real-time tracking of changes to C# entities for effective persistence.
Support for multiple database providers.

Before understanding this, let's understand what the Standard View is?
People typically use standard views as a tool that helps organize the logical objects and queries in a database. A standard view computes its data each time when the view is used. Now imagine a scenario where your BI report pulls data from a view connected to multiple tables, with lots of joins and aggregate functions, causing more compute-heavy operations such as shuffles and joins in query execution.
Eventually, these queries will take longer time to complete, particularly on large tables. Now, each time your BI model refreshes, it has to run those same complex queries again, which impacts the performance of your BI report, too.

While this demo is a full tutorial for deploying an App Service Web App, Database, Managed Identity, and Azure OpenAI, most of the code and instructions for each section can be repurposed for individually unique use-cases. If you already know how to perform some of these actions (there's ample documentation on most of this in Microsoft Learn Documentation), feel free to skip ahead and focus on the sections most useful to your needs.

In Azure Storage, Blob Lifecycle Management (BLM) allows you to automate the management of your data based on rules defined by the user. Lifecycle management policies are supported for block blobs and append blobs in general-purpose v2, premium block blob, and Blob Storage accounts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overcoming Asymmetrical Routing in Azure Virtual WAN: A Collaborative Journey
In the rapidly evolving landscape of cloud networking, professionals often encounter complex challenges that demand innovative solutions. This blog post delves into a recent scenario involving Azure Virtual WAN (VWAN), where a team embarked on a collaborative journey to address asymmetrical routing issues. This case study not only highlights the technical intricacies but also underscores the importance of collaboration and knowledge sharing in the tech community.

 
 
The Challenge:
The core issue revolved around asymmetrical routing within an Azure VWAN architecture, which included two hubs located in different regions. The primary goal was to ensure seamless connectivity between a Palo Alto NGFW in one hub and Panorama in another, without disrupting the existing VPN default routes. The asymmetry in routing was particularly problematic for traffic intended to reach Panorama from the NGFW, as the return traffic defaulted through the VPN, deviating from the desired path.

The configuration issue with the firewall is acknowledged as a known issue. The only mitigation provided is documented in Microsoft's official documentation. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/whats-new#known-issues

 

 
Possible solutions:

Exposing the Panorama to the public IP and creating a relay subnet for routing / advertising summary route from NCUS to SCUS for NCUS subnet (10.193.0.0/16)]]></summary>

Historically, data extraction from unstructured documents was a manual and tedious process. It consisted of a combination of constant human involvement or the incorporation of tools that were limited, due to the various document formats, inability to recognize font color and styles, and the document’s data quality being substandard.
 
These methods were time-consuming and often resulted in errors due to the complexities involved in understanding and interpreting unstructured data. The process also lacked scalability, making it difficult to process large volumes of documents efficiently.

For instance, customer support chatbots need business-related information, while legal bots rely on historical case data. Developers commonly use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to fetch relevant knowledge from a database and improve AI responses. However, traditional RAG approaches often miss context during retrieval, leading to failures. In this post, we introduce "Contextual Retrieval," a method using Contextual Embeddings to improve retrieval accuracy, cutting failures with reranking.

Java applications often face startup delays due to their runtime initialization and class loading processes. In the cloud-native era, applications start and stop more frequently, with an increasing need for scale-out to accommodate dynamic traffic demands, making this issue even more prominent. To mitigate this, CRaC (Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint) offers a solution to this challenge by allowing applications to be checkpointed and restored, thus avoiding lengthy startup time after the first initialization. Based on the experiment on the Spring PetClinic project project, we observed a 7x improvement in startup speed after enabling CRaC on Azure Kubernetes Service.

This enhancement allows you to define precise failure conditions based on the performance of your server-side components, providing greater insight into performance bottlenecks and resource throttling issues.
Why Server-Side Metrics Matter
Traditionally, Azure Load Testing has empowered users to define test-failure criteria tailored to client-side metrics.

Customers follow the Microsoft doc to create CMK encrypted objects (data source, index etc.), but get the 500 Internal Server Error:
{'error':{'code':'','message':'Could not use key vault key to wrap/unwrap the encryption key. {\\'Message\\':\\'An error has occurred.\\'}'}
Possible Causes

The key vault host is incorrect, e.g. incorrect key vault name or domain.

Action: check the keyVaultUri in the Json payload to make sure it is correct.


The key vault host is inaccessible to search. For example, the key vault has public network access disabled but does not have a shared private link (SPL) configured from search. 

Action: check the SPL configurations or create a SPL and make sure it is approved. 



Note that if the key vault Uri is correct or accessible, the error message due to a wrong key vault key name or version in the JSON payload is slightly different. The error message has the complete key vault key path.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction:
 
In this post, I explore a recent experiment aimed at creating a RAG pipeline tailored for the insurance industry, specifically for handling automobile insurance claims, with the goal of potentially reducing processing times.
 
I also showcase the implementation of Autogen AI Agents to enhance search retrieval through agent interaction and function calls on sample auto insurance claims documents, a Q&A use case, and how this workflow can substantially reduce the time required for claims processing.
 
RAG workflows in my opinion represent a novel data stack, distinct from traditional ETL processes. Although they encompass data ingestion and processing similar to traditional ETL in data engineering, they introduce additional pipeline stages like chunking, embedding, and the lo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Function as a Service (FaaS) helps developers work better by offering a fast, scalable way to execute a task in response to an event without the need to manage infrastructure. A function transforms input to output, making it a lightweight choice for scheduled tasks, reminders, order processing and other actions that don’t require fault tolerance more complex than simple retries. Plus, functions run on a cloud host’s infrastructure, scaling in and out on demand, and you only pay for the resources you consume.
 
But what if you have workflows that need more reliability and fault tolerance than a short-lived function provides? What if your scenario includes longer-running tasks or your business logic needs the output of one function as the input to another?
 
That’s when you need solutions de…]]></summary>
