The BBC Micro:bit has proved very popular in UK schools as a cheap and simple device that can be used to demonstrate basic coding, either using a building block approach or by using Python code in an editor. There are browser-based tools to allow editing of the code in either mode.

The BBC Micro:bit is then connected via USB and the browser is then able to upload the code to the BBC Micro:bit. Thus making it a very interactive experience.
What if the power of Azure OpenAI prompts could be combined with the simplicity of the BBC Micro:bit to allow prompts to directly program the BBC Micro:bit?

We used the method of `accelerate` + `deepspeed` + `transformers` + `trl.GRPOTrainer`. Do not use `unsloth` acceleration because it does not yet support distributed training.  
For faster experimental speed, I used the 0.5B and 1.5B versions of Qwen2.5.  
The code to config the `deepspeed` backend in `accelerate` is in `train/r1/phi4grpo_zero2.yaml` (yes, the `deepspeed` configuration file is the same as when using `phi4`). Note that the number of `num_processes` should be set to the number of GPUs specified in the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable minus one, because one GPU needs to be reserved for `vllm` to generate the `group relative policy`.

Moodle is an open-source learning platform that was developed in 1999 by Martin Dougiamas, a computer scientist and educator from Australia. Moodle stands for Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment, and it is written in PHP, a popular web programming language. Moodle aims to provide educators and learners with a flexible and customizable online environment for teaching and learning, where they can create and access courses, activities, resources, and assessments.

Recent advancements in both the training procedures and serving infrastructure have dramatically lowered the barriers to creating domain-specific AI solutions. Fine-tuning not only boosts model accuracy but also reduces operational costs related to token consumption. Additionally, by customizing smaller LLM variants (for example, moving from a larger GPT‑4 model to a “GPT‑4-mini” model), teams can accelerate inference speed and more efficiently manage compute resources.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SFTP is a feature which is supported for Azure Blob Storage with hierarchical namespace (ADLS Gen2 Storage Account). As documented, the permission system used by SFTP feature is different from normal permission system in Azure Storage Account. It’s using a form of identity management called local users.
 
Normally the permission which user can set up on local users while creating them is on container level. But in real user case, it’s usual that user needs to configure multiple local users, and each local user only has permission on one specific directory. In this scenario, using ACLs (Access control lists) for local users will be a great solution.
 
In this blog, we’ll set up an environment using ACLs for local users and see how it meets the above aim.

Embeddings are used to generate a representation of unstructured data in a dense vector space. An embedding is a vector of floating-point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlates to semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format (eg., text / image). When text is embedded, the meaning of each word is encoded so that words closer together in the vector space are expected to have similar meanings. A large number of embedding models that support such text representations are available and benchmarks like MTEB help understand their performance.
One of the pitfalls / risks in embedding models is that sometimes models may not be able to adequately represent the underlying data. This could be due to the following scenarios…]]></summary>

Input Structure and Context Handling

Built-in Reasoning vs. Prompted Reasoning: O1-series models have built-in chain-of-thought reasoning, meaning they internally reason through steps without needing explicit coaxing from the prompt​.​ In contrast, GPT-4o often benefits from external instructions like “Let’s think step by step” to solve complex problems, since it doesn’t automatically engage in multi-step reasoning to the same extent​.

In this turorial, we'll build a simple chatbot that uses Azure OpenAI to generate responses to user queries.
To create a basic chatbot, we need to set up a language model resource that enables conversation capabilities. In this tutorial, we will:

Set up the Azure OpenAI resource using the Azure AI Foundry portal.
Retrieve the API key needed to connect the resource to your chatbot application.

Once the API key is configured in your code, you will be able to integrate the language model into your chatbot and enable it to generate responses.
By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a working chatbot that can generate responses using the Azure OpenAI model.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past few months, we gradually rolled out the new Log Analytics experience to our users. The feedback has been positive, and the telemetry shows that users are more successful at working with their data. Today, we’re excited to announce that the new Log Analytics experience, including Simple Mode and other improvements, is now fully available and enabled by default. 
How simple is it? Here are two quick examples: 
Investigate Workspace Usage: 

Double-click the Usage table to load the latest data. 
Add an Aggregate operation to sum the Quantity column by DataType.
Add a Sort operation by Quantity, and instantly see the results organized. 
At the top-right, click the three dots and create a New Alert Rule. 


 
Troubleshoot Kubernetes Pods: 

Select the KubePodInventory table and click Run to view the latest data. 
Filter the PodStatus column to Pending. 
Add an Aggregate operator to count the failed pods by Name. 
Click Share and export the results to CSV.  


That’s it - just a few clicks, and you’ve gained meaningful insights!  
Seamless Transition for Advanced Users 
If you’re comfortable with Kusto Query Language (KQL), you can switch to KQL Mode, edit the auto-generated query, and dive deeper. Once done, you can switch back to Simple Mode to continue exploring with updated results. You can also set your preferred default mode through the Settings menu for a customized experience. 
Improved Usability
The interface includes organized menus for key actions like Save, Share, and Export, and a collapsible pane for quick access to tables, saved queries, examples, and more. 
To dive deeper into Simple Mode and other recent updates, visit our official documentation.   
Your Feedback Matters

In modern cloud applications, managing different environments (such as development, staging, and production) is crucial for ensuring smooth deployment and testing workflows.
Azure Container Apps offers a powerful feature through labels and traffic splitting that can help developers easily manage multiple versions of an app, route traffic based on different environments, and enable controlled feature testing without disrupting live users.
In this blog, we'll walk through a practical scenario where we deploy an experimental feature in a staging revision, test it with internal developers, and then switch the feature to production once it’s validated. We'll use Azure Container Apps labels and traffic splitting to achieve this seamless deployment process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI Toolkit is a VS Code extension aiming to empower AI engineers in transforming their curiosity into advanced generative AI applications. This toolkit, featuring both local-enabled and cloud-accelerated inner loop capabilities, is set to ease model exploration, prompt engineering, and the creation and evaluation of generative applications. We are pleased to announce the January Update to the toolkit with support for OpenAI's o1 model and enhancements in the Model Playground and Bulk Run features.
What's New?
January’s update brings several exciting new features to boost your productivity in AI development. Here's a closer look at what's included:

Support for OpenAI’s new o1 Model: We've added access to GitHub hosted OpenAI’s latest o1 model. This new model replaces the o1-preview and offers even better performance in handling complex tasks. You can start interacting with the o1 model within VS Code for free by using the latest AI Toolkit update.
Chat History Support in Model Playground: We have heard your feedback that tracking past model interactions is crucial. The Model Playground has been updated to include support for chat history. This feature saves chat history as individual files stored entirely on your local machine, ensuring privacy and security.
Bulk Run with Prompt Templating: The Bulk Run feature, introduced in the AI Toolkit December release, now supports prompt templating with variables. This allows users to create templates for prompts, insert variables, and run them in bulk. This enhancement simplifies the process of testing multiple scenarios and models.

Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements as we continue to innovate and support your journey in AI development.

Why Scalable and Efficient Fine-Tuning Matters
Faster Iterations, Shorter Time-to-Value:
In today’s competitive AI landscape, time is of the essence. The faster you can fine-tune a model, the quicker you can validate ideas, test hypotheses, and bring solutions to market.
High-profile GPU machines are costly:
High-performance GPUs and compute clusters don’t come cheap, and their availability is often limited. Efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as model sharding and distributed training, maximize the utilization of these precious resources—ensuring that you get the most out of your infrastructure investment.

In simple terms, this means that when our customers have an App Service, it often runs as part of the backend pool of an Azure Application Gateway or is configured as the origin in an Azure Front Door profile, which is great because this setup is beneficial for several reasons.
Firstly, it enhances security by obfuscation. With a reverse proxy in the data path, clients only contact the reverse proxy instances and are unaware of the second connection between the reverse proxy instances and the real backend.

As usage of Azure DevOps organisations grow so do the number of projects, repositories, pipelines and agent pools used. With new services available such as Managed DevOps Pools it can appear a mammoth task for central IT function to manually trawl through every pipeline noting down each agentpool being used. Replacing these values potentially even more complicated after creating the new agent pools and mapping them with potential for human error.
Solution
As there is no built in reporting for this at the moment I have built a bespoke bash script that can be ran to generate a report and optionally replace the values in each pipeline for a new agentpool.

In this blog post I document my experience of spending a full day using KAITO and Copilot to accelerate deployment and development of a self managed AI enabled chatbot deployed in a managed cluster. The goal is to showcase how quickly using a mix of AI tooling we can go from zero to a self hosted, tuned LLM and chatbot application. 
At the top of this article I want to share my perspective on the future of projects such as KAITO. At the moment I believe KAITO to be somewhat ahead of its time, as most enterprises begin adopting abstracted artificial intelligence it is brilliant to see projects like KAITO being developed ready for the eventual abstraction pendulum to swing back, motivated by usual factors such as increased skills in the market, cost and governance.

It allows them to select the configuration that best meets their requirements without investing significantly in physical hardware. VMs provide flexibility and scalability, which can be particularly advantageous for developers, machine learning engineers, and data scientists.

GitHub Copilot es un asistente de programación impulsado por Inteligencia Artificial (IA) que puede ejecutarse en varios entornos, ayudándote a ser más eficiente en tus tareas diarias de programación. En este blog, te mostraremos específicamente cómo funciona GitHub Copilot en Visual Studio y cómo puede aumentar tu productividad.
Comprendiendo la diferencia entre GitHub Copilot y GitHub Copilot Chat:
GitHub Copilot funciona directamente en tus archivos de código, proporcionando sugerencias para tu código. Funciona de manera similar a IntelliSense, pero es capaz de proponer bloques completos de código en base a lo que estás escribiendo. También proporciona acceso a comandos, puede explicar el código y ofrecer funciones adicionales directamente respecto a tus archivos.
GitHub Copilot Chat funciona en una ventana independiente dentro del entorno de Visual Studio. Proporciona un asistente de chat que puede recordar el contexto de la conversación y ofrecer sugerencias inteligentes.
Ambas extensiones se pueden instalar por separado. Te recomendamos probar ambas para que puedas elegir la que prefieras. En próximas oportunidades, te mostraremos más detalles sobre cada una de estas extensiones.
Instalando las extensiones de GitHub Copilot
Ambas extensiones se pueden instalar directamente desde Visual Studio, a través del menú Extensiones / Administrar extensiones. Desde allí, busca GitHub Copilot y GitHub Copilot Chat.

También puedes dirigirte a Visual Studio Marketplace, que contiene una gran cantidad de extensiones para mejorar tu experiencia con Visual Studio.
Ten en cuenta que GitHub Copilot requiere Visual Studio 2022 17.5.5 o posterior.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, viewing your Java or Java WebServer version on Linux is typically a two-step process involving first creating a remote connection, and then connecting to the remote connection to view your web app's info. Note that these steps do NOT work on App Service Windows applications, this applies only to App Service Linux.
Viewing your minor and patch version on App Service Linux for Java applications is possible by first setting up a remote connection to your Linux webapp by running the following command:
az webapp create-remote-connection -g {RESOURCE_GROUP} -n {WEBAPP_NAME}
This will result in something like this:

After creating the remote connection, we can connect to the webapp and view the info we’re looking for. Using another terminal window, to connect to our remote connection run the following command:
ssh root@127.0.0.1 -m hmac-sha1 -p {PORT_NUMBER}
After entering the password shown in the previous step, we will now have shell access to the web app. Now we can view our Java and webserver version.
To view Java version:
java -version
To view Tomcat version:
sh /usr/local/tomcat/version.sh
If your Tomcat Webserver is in a different location, we can locate it by running:
find / -name "version.sh"
To connect and view Java version with one command:
ssh root@127.0.0.1 -m hmac-sha1 -p {PORT_NUMBER} /usr/lib/jdk/bin/java -version
To connect and view Tomcat version with one command:

Sometimes it is useful to call APIs hosted in Azure App Service that has been configured to use Easy Auth.
By default Easy Auth allows the web application itself to be authenticated in a browser. This redirects to Microsoft Entra to then allow the user to enter their credentials. The application is then authenticated and any APIs hosted in the App Service can then be used.
Sometimes it may be useful to call these APIs programmatically from code, VS Code or Postman. This opens up the possibility of driving the APIs hosted in App Service programmatically. This can be very useful for testing generative AI solution accelerators automatically.

        <updated>2024-12-31T08:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
Say goodbye to constantly running Spark clusters! With the shared metadata functionality, you can shut down your Spark pools while still be able to query your Spark external tables using Serverless SQL Pool.
In this blog we dive into, how Serverless SQL Pool streamlines your data workflow by automatically synchronizing metadata from your Spark pools.
Shared Metadata functionality
Azure Synapse Analytics allows the different workspace computational engines to share databases and tables between its Apache Spark pools and serverless SQL pool.
When we create tables in Apache Spark Pool, whether managed or external, the Serverless SQL pool automatically synchronizes its metadata. This metadata synchronization automatically creates a corresponding external table in a serverless SQL pool database. Then after a short delay, we can see the table in our Serverless SQL pool.
Creating a managed table in Spark and querying from Serverless SQL Pool

Now we can shut down our Spark pools and still be able to query Spark external tables from Serverless SQL Pool.


NOTE: Azure Synapse currently only shares managed and external Spark tables that store their data in Parquet, DELTA, or CSV format. Tables backed by other formats are not automatically synced. 
You may be able to sync such tables explicitly yourself as an external table in your own SQL database if the SQL engine supports the table's underlying format.
Also, External tables created in Spark are not available in dedicated SQL pool databases.

Why we get an error if you use dbo schema in Spark pool or if you don’t use dbo schema in Serverless SQL pool?
The dbo schema (short for “database owner”) is the default schema in SQL Server and Azure Synapse SQL pools.
Spark pool only supports user-defined schemas. Means, it does not recognize dbo as a valid schema name. While in Serverless SQL Pool, all the tables belong to the dbo schema, regardless of their original schema in Spark pool or other sources.]]></summary>

While many licensing systems rely on simple API calls or basic key validation, creating a more secure system demands a deeper understanding of cryptographic principles and secure communication patterns.
At its core, a secure licensing system must solve several fundamental challenges. How do we ensure that validation responses haven't been tampered with? How can we prevent replay attacks where valid responses are captured and reused? This article will present a robust solution to these challenges using cryptographic signatures, nonce validation, and secure key management.

Data serves as the vital essence of any organization. Whether you’re dealing with sensitive customer information, or financial records, safeguarding your data is non-negotiable.
Many organizations face challenges such as:

How do you protect the data if you don't know where it is?
What level of protection is needed? —because some datasets require more protection than others.

Azure Synapse Analytics offers powerful features to help you achieve this, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Introduction
When using the Graph API to manage mail-related services, setting the permission to Delegate permission restricts the authorization to the user’s identity, limiting management to the specific user’s mailbox. While this might not be sufficient for certain business scenarios, Application permission, on the other hand, allows authorization under the App’s identity, enabling access to all users’ mailboxes within the tenant, which could be overly broad for certain use cases.
Therefore, a method is required that allows the management of a specific mailbox using the App’s identity.
This scenario is not recommended to use Delegate permission and requires some prerequisites, which are …]]></summary>

A key component in Arabic TTS is the diacritic model, which represents a challenging task. In written Arabic, diacritics, which indicate vowel sounds, are typically omitted. The diacritic task involves predicting the diacritic for each Arabic character in the written form. We enhanced diacritic prediction by utilizing a base model pre-trained with Machine Translation and other NLP tasks, then fine-tuning it on a comprehensive diacritics' corpus. This approach reduced word-level pronunciation errors by 78%.

The assets of a bank are only accessible to some high-ranking officials, and even they don't have access to individual user lockers. These privacy features help build trust among customers. The same goes with in our IT world. Every user wants their sensitive data to be accessible only to themselves, not even available to those with higher privileges within the company. So, as you move data to the cloud, securing the data assets is critical to building trust with your customers and partners.
To enable these kinds of preventions, Azure Synapse supports a wide range of advanced access control features to control who can access what data. These features are:

For developers and organizations looking to implement AI solutions on edge devices or with limited resources, Small Language Models (SLMs) are emerging as a practical alternative.
SLMs are not just "smaller" versions of their larger counterparts—they're designed to be faster, more efficient, and adaptable for specific tasks. With fewer parameters and lower computational needs, SLMs open the door to deploying AI on mobile devices, IoT systems, and edge environments without compromising performance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
In many enterprise environments, it's common for organizations to have multiple Azure tenants, each serving different teams, projects, or departments. While this segregation adds a layer of security and control, it can also introduce challenges, especially when resources need to interact across these tenants. 
 
One common scenario is when developers need their Azure Container App in one tenant to pull container images from an Azure Container Registry (ACR) located in another tenant. This is particularly useful for organizations that centralize their container images in a shared registry, perhaps managed by a DevOps team, while allowing individual teams from different tenants to deploy applications using those images. So let’s dive into how you can set this up seamlessly.

The blobfuse2 functionality is used to mount Azure Storage Account as file system on Linux machine. To establish the connection with storage account via blobfuse2 and to authenticate the request against the storage account, we make use of configuration file for it. The configuration file contains the storage account details along with the container to be mounted and what mode of authentication to be used. The configuration yaml file includes parameters for blobfuse2 settings. 
In general, the details saved in configuration file are in plain text. Hence, if any users access the configuration file, they would be able to access the sensitive information related to the storage account, like for example, the storage account access keys and SAS token.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today at Ignite, we are thrilled to announce the General Availability of Kubernetes Metadata and Logs Filtering in Azure Monitor – Container Insights! This enhancement brings additional Kubernetes metadata to the ContainerLogsV2 schema, including PodLabels, PodAnnotations, PodUid, Image, ImageID, ImageRepo, and ImageTag. Moreover, the new Logs Filtering feature allows for precise filtering of both workload and system pods/containers. These advancements not only provide users with richer context and enhanced visibility into their workloads but are crucial for customer troubleshooting as they provide deeper insights into the Kubernetes environment.
Key Features

Enhanced ContainerLogV2 schema with Kubernetes Metadata Fields: Detailed metadata fields enhance log analysis. These include “podLabels,” “podAnnotations,” “podUid,” “image,” “imageID,” “imageRepo,” and “imageTag.”
Customized Include List Configuration: Users can tailor metadata fields via ConfigMap. All fields are collected by default.
Enhanced ContainerLogV2 schema with Log Level: Assess application health with color-coded severity levels (e.g., CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING). Helps incident response and proactive monitoring.
Annotation Based Log Filtering for workloads: Efficient log filtering through podAnnotations. Focus on relevant information, optimizing costs and resource usage.
ConfigMap Based Log Filtering for platform logs (System Kubernetes Namespaces): Enables ability to configure log collection of specific pods within the system namespaces through ConfigMap.
Grafana Dashboard for Visualization: Leverage the power of Grafana Dashboard to visualize log levels, log volume, rate, records, and more. Empowers in-depth analysis and real-time monitoring. 


To learn more and enable this new feature, please visit our Kubernetes Metadata and Logs Filtering Documentation.

So, why are we so obsessed with large-scale AI models anyway? Well, larger models have more parameters—think of these as tiny levers and switches that adjust to learn from data. The more parameters, the more complex tasks a model can handle. In the world of natural language processing (NLP), for instance, GPT-3 boasts 175 billion parameters, making it capable of understanding nuanced language and generating impressive responses.  
These larger models don’t just stop at text. They’re pushing boundaries in healthcare, finance, and beyond, handling things like medical image analysis, fraud detection, and even predicting patient outcomes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are thrilled to announce that Conversational Diagnostics (Public Preview) is coming to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)! This new functionality will be available in the "Diagnose and solve problems" section of the Azure Portal, starting at Ignite 2024.
Diagnose and Solve Problems with Conversational Diagnostics
Conversational Diagnostics leverages natural language processing to help you troubleshoot and resolve issues with your AKS clusters more efficiently. By simply describing your problem in plain language, you can get targeted diagnostics and solutions, making it easier to maintain the health and performance of your AKS deployments.
In Azure Portal under the Diagnose and solve problems the GIF is demonstrating Conversational Diagnostics, which uses natural language, to diagnose problems with an AKS cluster related to CPU Pressure on the nodes.
Availability and Future Developments
Conversational Diagnostics (Public Preview) for AKS will be available as part of Ignite 2024. Shortly after, the AKS + Conversational Diagnostics (Public Preview) integration will expand to Copilot in Azure and GitHub Copilot via azure.
 
With the integration of Conversational Diagnostics into Copilot in Azure, you can now access powerful diagnostic tools from anywhere in Azure Portal allowing you to quickly identify and resolve issues without leaving your workflow, enhancing productivity, and reducing downtime.
 
The expansion of Conversational Diagnostics to GitHub Copilot means that developers can now benefit from advanced troubleshooting capabilities while writing code, providing near real-time diagnostics and suggestions to help catch and fix issues early in the development process.
 
Stay tuned for more updates and detailed demonstrations at Ignite 2024. We look forward to seeing how Conversational Diagnostics will transform the way you manage and troubleshoot your AKS clusters.
 
Thank you!]]></summary>

In modern IT environments, securely accessing on-premises resources from remote locations is a common challenge. Traditional methods, such as setting up VPNs, often require complex configurations and can introduce significant overhead. For organizations seeking a more streamlined solution, Azure Relay, combined with the open-source tool Azure Relay Bridge (azbridge), offers an efficient way to establish secure, direct connections without the need for VPNs.
Azbridge leverages Azure Relay to create TCP, UDP, HTTP, and Unix Socket tunnels, enabling secure traversal through NATs and firewalls using only outbound HTTPS (443) connectivity. This makes it ideal for connecting remote clients to on-premises resources, such as Remote …]]></summary>

Using Entity Framework Core offers several advantages:

No need to learn a new language; utilize C# and LINQ.
Tooling to maintain synchronization between C# models and database tables.
Real-time tracking of changes to C# entities for effective persistence.
Support for multiple database providers.

Before understanding this, let's understand what the Standard View is?
People typically use standard views as a tool that helps organize the logical objects and queries in a database. A standard view computes its data each time when the view is used. Now imagine a scenario where your BI report pulls data from a view connected to multiple tables, with lots of joins and aggregate functions, causing more compute-heavy operations such as shuffles and joins in query execution.
Eventually, these queries will take longer time to complete, particularly on large tables. Now, each time your BI model refreshes, it has to run those same complex queries again, which impacts the performance of your BI report, too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overcoming Asymmetrical Routing in Azure Virtual WAN: A Collaborative Journey
In the rapidly evolving landscape of cloud networking, professionals often encounter complex challenges that demand innovative solutions. This blog post delves into a recent scenario involving Azure Virtual WAN (VWAN), where a team embarked on a collaborative journey to address asymmetrical routing issues. This case study not only highlights the technical intricacies but also underscores the importance of collaboration and knowledge sharing in the tech community.

 
 
The Challenge:
The core issue revolved around asymmetrical routing within an Azure VWAN architecture, which included two hubs located in different regions. The primary goal was to ensure seamless connectivity between a Palo Alto NGFW in one hub and Panorama in another, without disrupting the existing VPN default routes. The asymmetry in routing was particularly problematic for traffic intended to reach Panorama from the NGFW, as the return traffic defaulted through the VPN, deviating from the desired path.

The configuration issue with the firewall is acknowledged as a known issue. The only mitigation provided is documented in Microsoft's official documentation. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/whats-new#known-issues

 

 
Possible solutions:

Exposing the Panorama to the public IP and creating a relay subnet for routing / advertising summary route from NCUS to SCUS for NCUS subnet (10.193.0.0/16)]]></summary>

Historically, data extraction from unstructured documents was a manual and tedious process. It consisted of a combination of constant human involvement or the incorporation of tools that were limited, due to the various document formats, inability to recognize font color and styles, and the document’s data quality being substandard.
 
These methods were time-consuming and often resulted in errors due to the complexities involved in understanding and interpreting unstructured data. The process also lacked scalability, making it difficult to process large volumes of documents efficiently.
 
With the advancements of LLMs, the ability to extract data from unstructured documents has significantly improved and offers users a more adaptable solution based on their indivi…]]></summary>

For instance, customer support chatbots need business-related information, while legal bots rely on historical case data. Developers commonly use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to fetch relevant knowledge from a database and improve AI responses. However, traditional RAG approaches often miss context during retrieval, leading to failures. In this post, we introduce "Contextual Retrieval," a method using Contextual Embeddings to improve retrieval accuracy, cutting failures with reranking.

Java applications often face startup delays due to their runtime initialization and class loading processes. In the cloud-native era, applications start and stop more frequently, with an increasing need for scale-out to accommodate dynamic traffic demands, making this issue even more prominent. To mitigate this, CRaC (Coordinated Restore at Checkpoint) offers a solution to this challenge by allowing applications to be checkpointed and restored, thus avoiding lengthy startup time after the first initialization. Based on the experiment on the Spring PetClinic project project, we observed a 7x improvement in startup speed after enabling CRaC on Azure Kubernetes Service.

ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open format used to represent machine learning and deep learning models. It was introduced by Microsoft and Facebook in 2017, aiming to facilitate model interoperability between different deep learning frameworks. With ONNX, you can seamlessly convert models between different deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.
 
Currently, ONNX fine-tuning can be done using Olive, but it does not yet support LoRA. If you want to perform LoRA fine-tuning with PyTorch and use ORT for inference, how can this be achieved?

First, fine-tune the model using LoRA. Do not use QLoRA, as it may result in significant…]]></summary>

This new voice-based interface also brings an interesting new challenge with it: how do you implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), the prevailing pattern for combining language models with your own data, in a system that uses audio for input and output?
 
In this blog post we present a simple architecture for voice-based generative AI applications that enables RAG on top of the real-time audio API with full-duplex audio streaming from client devices, while securely handling access to both model and retrieval system.

Customers follow the Microsoft doc to create CMK encrypted objects (data source, index etc.), but get the 500 Internal Server Error:
{'error':{'code':'','message':'Could not use key vault key to wrap/unwrap the encryption key. {\\'Message\\':\\'An error has occurred.\\'}'}
Possible Causes

The key vault host is incorrect, e.g. incorrect key vault name or domain.

Action: check the keyVaultUri in the Json payload to make sure it is correct.


The key vault host is inaccessible to search. For example, the key vault has public network access disabled but does not have a shared private link (SPL) configured from search. 

Action: check the SPL configurations or create a SPL and make sure it is approved. 



Note that if the key vault Uri is correct or accessible, the error message due to a wrong key vault key name or version in the JSON payload is slightly different. The error message has the complete key vault key path.
