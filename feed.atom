To simplify application deployment on Kubernetes, we’re building an experience that brings together a set of tools and AKS add-ons to help you get from source code to running on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using familiar tools and environments like Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and the Azure portal.
 
Let’s take a look.
 
What does it take to run an app on Kubernetes?
If you think about it, if you start from a source code of an application, say a microservice, that you want to run on Kubernetes, there are a number of steps and prerequisites:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Move app service resources across subscriptions
Many customers try to migrate across subscriptions, resource groups, and so on. Sometimes they use uploaded certificates in the App service instead of ASC.This blog will be helpful when they migrate App service resources with uploaded certificates. I wrote this blog for testing based on Azure docs.
 
See move across subscriptions 

 
Testing Steps
1. Prerequisites
2. Upload and bind certificates to App Service
3. Do the migration
4. Validate the result
 
1. Prerequisites
- App Service- App service domain: in my case, tlsmigrationtest.com- Add a custom domain to App Service: SSL isn't bound yet

 
2. Upload and bind certificates
Upload certificate (.pfx) and bind certificate to the app service domain.
A. App service > TLS/SSL settings > Private Key Certificates (.pfx) > Upload Certificate

 
B. Upload the certificate

C. Bind certificates
App Service > Custom domains > Add bindings

 
After finishing the above steps, you can see the SSL binding to the App Service domain.

 
3. Migration across subscriptions with uploaded certificates
A. For migration, go to your resource group.
 
B. Before moving resources you must click "show hidden types"
When you check "show hidden types", you can see uploaded certificates.

 
C. Check all App service resources and click move to another subscription
You must move all App Service resources together such as App Service, App service domain, and certificates.
Check limitation Move Azure App Service resources across resource groups or subscriptions - Azure Resource Manager | Microsoft Learn

 
D. Validate the result
Before you migrate app service resources, you can see the validation status.
If you can see succeeded status like below, you will be able to migrate successfully.

 
4. Success migration
Uploaded app service certificates are still bound to the App Service domain in the new subscription.]]></summary>

So you're building serverless applications with Microsoft Azure Functions, but you need to persist data to a database. What do you do about controlling the number of concurrent connections to your database from the function? What happens if the function currently connected to your database shuts down or a new instance comes online to scale with demand?
 
The concept of serverless in general, whether that be through a function or database, is great because it is designed for the modern application. Applications that scale on-demand reduce the maintenance overhead and applications that are pay as you go reduce unnecessary costs.

Impact



Users who have applied the mitigation should take note of the following impact:



No authorized scopes are mapped to the principal (current user) when the Authorization Server (AS) responds to the OAuth2 Access Token Response with an empty or missing scope parameter.



If you are affected by this vulnerability, users will not be granted any authorities beginning with SCOPE_ when the AS does not return scopes. Only the special authority ROLE_USER is given to the principal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure App Service on Linux images using PHP 8.x are now bundled with NGINX instead of Apache. The use of .htaccess files will not work for NGINX as these are used for Apache only. This will require the need to setup a custom startup script and modifying the existing NGINX site configuration.
 

 
Navigate to your App Service via the Azure Portal. Under the Development Tools section, select SSH then Go -->.
Modifying the default site config
You will want to make a copy of the existing configuration and place the file inside the /home/site directory.
 


cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /home/site/default


Once you created a default page as in the previous step, please update the location block to add HSTS Header and create the custom startup script as mentioned below
  
location / {           
index  index.php index.html index.htm hostingstart.html;
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
}
Creating the custom startup script
You will now need to create a custom startup script and save the file as /home/site/startup.sh



#!/bin/bash

cp /home/site/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
service nginx reload


In the custom startup script, we are doing the following:

Overriding the existing /etc/nginx/sites-available/default file with the /home/site/default file.
Reloading the NGINX service to make the updates take effect.

Updating the application settings
Navigate back to your App Service via the Azure Portal. Under the Settings section, select Configuration.
Go over to the General Settings section of the Configuration blade.
For the Startup Command enter the following: /home/site/startup.sh
Save these settings and navigate to your application https://{sitename}.azurewebsites.net/

AKS takes more and more space in the Azure landscape, and there are a few best practices that you can follow to harden the environment and make it as secure as possible. As a preamble, remember that containers all share the kernel through system calls, so the level of isolation in the container world is not as strong as with virtual machines, and even more as with physical hosts. Mistakes can quickly lead to security issues.
 
1. Hardening the application itself
This might sound obvious but one of the best ways to defend against malicious attacks, is to use bullet proof code. There is no way you'll be 100% bullet proof, but a few steps can be taken to maximize the robustness:

A good website should provide a seamless user experience from the home page through to the  "Your order has been successfully placed" notification. The seamless experience is critical as only 1 in 40 visitors makes a purchase.
Even being at the checkout stage doesn't guarantee a successful sale, as only 1 in 3 customers at the checkout stage makes a purchase. This makes the checkout the most critical step, meaning sellers need to optimize the experience accordingly.
The shopping cart is one of the most important parts of a user e-commerce session. The resiliency and latency of these sessions are the two aspects we'll focus on in this blog post.

        <updated>2022-10-25T13:55:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Spring community,



I was so eager to find and fix bugs in the latest Spring Integration release, that missed to announce a 6.0 RC1 last week.
But I believe it is still worth to mention it even after Spring Boot 3.0.0-RC1 announcement since there is a number of notable changes and improvements.



So, please, welcome Spring Integration 6.0 first Release Candidate.
It can be obtained from Spring Milestone repository:




dependencyManagement {
    imports {
        mavenBom 'org.springframework.integration:spring-integration-bom:6.0.0-RC1'
    }
}




Here you can find important changes after the previously announced Spring Integration 6.0.0-M5:





spring-integration-amqp has added support for RabbitMQ Streams;



spring-integration-sftp has been migrated from an old unsupported jsch library to more modern Apache MINA;



spring-integration-gemfire was removed according to dropped support for Apache Geode in Spring Data;



spring-integration-scripting has added a GraalVM Polyglot support for JavaScript invocations;



The Apache Groovy DSL for Spring Integration extension project has been migrated to the spring-integration-groovy module code base;



The Spring Integration for Apache Cassandra extension project has been migrated as a spring-integration-cassandra module;



The Kotlin Coroutines support has been added to the @ServiceActivator POJO functions, also messaging gateway methods can now be as suspended functions;



The AOP ChannelSecurityInterceptor in the spring-integration-security module has been deprecated in favor of AuthorizationChannelInterceptor.





Also, see a Migration Guide for breaking changes in the framework and its modules.



It would be great if you give it a chance and come back to us with reports, so it may make it into GA next month.



See you in person this December at SpringOne!



Cheers, 

Artem

Converting an application to a service is not easy. Even Microsoft had false starts with moving their on-premises applications to cloud-based offerings.

Show upcoming meetings for a Microsoft 365 user
Recently, I published an article on freeCodeCamp that shows you how you can build in just 10 minutes a simple personal assistant that shows upcoming meetings for the signed-in user.

 

 
Showing upcoming meetings is a common scenario when integrating Microsoft 365 in work applications. It shows you how to get information from the user's calendar and check their availability for a particular time slot. And it's also a great way to get started with building apps on Microsoft 365.
 
The tutorial shows you the basics of setting up auth in a single-page app and using the Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK to connect to the Microsoft Graph API. It also demonstrates working with calendar views and formatting dates.This is just one of many scenarios and types of apps that you can implement on Microsoft 365. For more information about the type of data and insights stored on Microsoft 365 that you can tap into, check out the Microsoft Graph API documentation.
 
Give it a try, and we're looking forward to hearing what you think.
30 Days of Microsoft Graph is a gamified learning experience for beginners to challenge themselves on building apps with Microsoft Graph and JavaScript based on the Top Microsoft Graph Scenarios, for a chance to win exciting prizes.

 
The challenge will start on November 1st and end on November 30th. Register for the 30 Days of Microsoft Graph Challenge today: https://aka.ms/30DaysOfMSGraph/Register]]></summary>

I’m in sunny Singapore, then off to Malaysia and Thailand. It’s the first time I’ve been to any of these places since 2019! How good it is to be back! I’ve so missed it.

The Spring team is busy preparing for both Spring Boot 3 (and the Spring Framework 6 release that underpins it) and SpringOne 2022. Have you booked your ticket for SpringOne 2022 yet? It’s going to be held in sunny San Francisco, and - of course - it’ll be the absolute best place to learn about Spring Framework 6, Spring Boot 3, GraalVM, the new Ahead-of-time compilation engine in Spring Boot 3, and more. Also, it’s a rare chance to hang out with the Spring team proper.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a function app, usually we use appsetting AzureWebJobsStorage to connect to storage. This blog shows you how to configure a function app using Azure Active Directory identities instead of secrets or connection strings, where possible. Using identities helps you avoid accidentally leaking sensitive secrets and can provide better visibility into how data is accessed.
 
This will not work if the storage account is in a sovereign cloud or has a custom DNS.
 
Below are the steps to do configuration.
 
1. Enable system assigned identity in your function app and save it.

 
2. Give storage access to your function app. Search for Storage Blob Data Owner, select it.

 
 

 

 
 
 
3. If you configure a blob-triggered function app, repeat the step 2 to add Storage Account Contributor and Storage Queue Data Contributor roles which will be used for blob trigger.

 

 
 
4. Return to Access Control (IAM), click Role assignments, search for your function app name to confirm the roles are added successfully.

 
 
5. Navigate to your function app. Select Configuration and edit AzureWebJobsStorage. Change the name to AzureWebJobsStorage__accountname.  Change the value to your storage account name. (The new setting uses a double underscore (__), which is a special character in application settings.) 

 
 
6. Delete the previous AzureWebJobsStorage. Then you will find your function app still works fine.]]></summary>

Microservice-based systems have become ubiquitous in the last couple of years. However, the idea of monolithic, modular systems has also regained popularity recently.
Independent of the architectural style ultimately selected, the individual applications comprising the overall system need their structure to be evolvable and able to follow changes in business requirements.



Traditionally, application frameworks have provided structural guidance by providing abstractions aligned with technical concepts, such as Spring Framework’s stereotype annotations (@Controller, @Service, @Repository, and so on).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is finally here! The first release candidate of Spring Batch 5 is now available from our milestone repository. In this release, we worked on the following items:


  
Execution context Meta-data improvement

  
GemFire support removal


This blog post walks through these two changes in details. For the complete list of changes, please check the release notes.
Execution context Meta-data improvement

In addition to what Spring Batch already persists in the execution context with regard to runtime information (like the step type, the restart flag, etc), this release adds an important detail in the execution context which is the Spring Batch version that was used to serialize the context.

While this seems a detail, it has a huge added value when debugging upgrade issues with regard to execution context serialization and deserialization.
GemFire support removal

Based on the decision to discontinue the support of Spring Data for Apache Geode, the support for Apache Geode in Spring Batch was removed.

The code was moved to the spring-batch-extensions repository as a community-driven effort.
What’s next?

We are planning to roll out a second release candidate early November and release 5.0.0 GA by the end of November, in time for Spring Boot 3.0.0. We would appreciate your help to try this release candidate out and share your feedback with us on Github, Twitter and StackOverflow. You can find a migration guide here.

I would like to thank all contributors who had a role in this first release candidate!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our ISV partners have been asking for a way to provide an easy way to package their Kubernetes based solutions into the Marketplace and we're excited to announce K8s Apps to meet their needs.
 
ISV's are excited about this because it allows them to transact their offers in the Azure Marketplace via CI/CD.  This includes 48 hour publishing turnaround, automated security vetting and a self-service experience.  Customers look forward to the easy deployment, automated patching and using these offers to decrement their MACC.
 
Since then, a lot of information has come out and our partners are looking for guidance on how to get started.  I've recorded this End-To-End video which walks through the steps of an ISV Creating and Publishing an Offer as well as a Customer Purchasing the offer.  This is a more detailed version of the demo seen at Ignite.
 



 
 
All of the code available for the Minecraft As A Service demo is on GitHub.
 
If you are an ISV and interested in getting started in the K8s Apps in the Marketplace, I recommend the following:
 

Read the blog for the Ignite Announcement
Watch the full demo video
Fill out the Public Preview Invite Form
Attend the Mastering Container Offers Workshop

 
When you're ready to publish your offer to the marketplace, these docs will guide you:

Create the Offer
Prepare your Technical Assets
Create/Publish offer in Partner Center
Deploy the Offer

Come join some of our other partners that have already taken the leap!

Tetrate Istio Distro
Elastic Cloud

I hope this helps you on your journey into K8s Apps on the Azure Marketplace and we'll see your offer available for customers soon.]]></summary>

I did a presentation with my friend and hero James Ward on Spring and Kotlin (that was voted third most-liked talk at a show with more than 250 speakers!) That was a personal career highlight for me - it’s not often you get to win and have fun in life. And, as if that wasn’t awesome enough, this week I am in Las Vegas, NV, for JavaOne! Fingers crossed, this week will go smoothly, too! Both Devoxx and JavaOne are the first such shows since at least before the pandemic. It’s been a very long time in coming and I’m elated, overjoyed, to be able to be here.

And, of course, I’m super excited about SpringOne 2022! Also, the first in-person show of its kind since before the pandemic! It’s going to be amazing. Have you registered? If not, you might consider using this registration code - S1VM22_Advocate_200.

And this week’s busy roundup reflects the usual flurry of activity on the Spring team as we ready releases for our end-of-November timelines for Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, which means we’ve got a ton of stuff to get into this week, so let’s!

The Spring Web Services team has released 4.0.0-RC1. This is the last planned release candidate that supports Spring Boot 3.0. The final GA release is coming next month in anticipation of Spring Boot 3.0 going GA.



4.0.x is the generation of Spring Web Services that works with Jakarta EE 9, the version where the enterprise specs (JAX-WS, etc.) migrate from javax. to jakarta.. See Juergen Holler’s blog post for more details about that.



Being based upon Spring Framework 6.0, this is also the generation of Spring Web Services that is rebased on top of Java 17 (LTS). So check it out!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m pleased to announce that the first release candidate of Spring for GraphQL 1.1.0 is now available from our Milestone repository. This version will be shipped with Spring Boot 3.0.0-RC1 due for release later this week.

This release candidate is the last stop for shipping new features; from that point, we’ll be focusing on bug fixes and documentation improvements. Our goal is to stabilize the current branch for our GA release scheduled next month.

With RC1, we’re shipping our new Observability support in Spring for GraphQL. Based on the new Micrometer Observation work, this infrastructure replaces the former GraphQL Metrics support in Spring Boot 2.7. GraphQL is a good use case for Observability in general, as the GraphQL engine can distribute the data fetching operations over caches, databases, REST APIs and more. It’s important not only to keep track of performance metrics for your GraphQL API, but also to be able to explore traces and investigate production issues.

We didn’t have time to tackle features like Pagination/Relay or AOT/Native support, but we’re listening to the community. We’re working on our roadmap for the next feature version, so now is the time to vote on existing issues to show your interest!

The annual Spring survey is here, it’s a great way to let us know what you think!
How can you help?

If you have general questions, please ask on stackoverflow.com using the spring-graphql tag.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, Spring fans! I was just at Devoxx in Belgium, where hundreds of experts from across the Java ecosystem converged for the first time since 2019 to deliver their biggest and best. 

I could do a proper trip report, but I really just came here to point you to two talks from two of my amazing teammates, Stéphane Nicoll (@snicoll) and Brian Clozel (@bclozel), who have been very hard at work on both Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, both of which will land by the end of November, 2022. These are brand new generations of the framework, implying huge new paradigms and new opportunities for developers. 

This first is a broader, whirlwind tour of the new features in Spring Framework 6 (which bubble up into Spring Boot 3).


This second one introduces the new ahead-of-time (AOT) support in Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, which makes it trivial to build GraalVM native images.



NB: please ignore the metadata for the YouTube videos. Both talks feature both speakers, and there is no mention whatsoever of React and JavaScript and the like. I think that was a metadata issue with the publication of the videos on YouTube, which will hopefully be resolved. 

Enjoy!]]></summary>

Web PubSub is an Azure-managed service that helps developers easily build real-time web applications using websockets and publish-subscribe pattern. Any platform supporting WebSocket APIs can connect to the service easily, e.g. web pages, mobile applications, edge devices, etc. The service manages the WebSocket connections for you and allows up to 100K *concurrent connections. It provides powerful APIs for you to manage these clients and deliver real-time messages.

The easiest way to connect your app to Microsoft 365
Using Microsoft Graph Toolkit is the easiest way to connect your app to Microsoft 365. Toolkit's components help you retrieve relevant data from Microsoft 365 and show it in your app in any way you want. And with toolkit's authentication providers, setting up auth is a matter of adding a few lines of code. Never again fiddle with setting up a login, handling access tokens, building web requests, and dealing with errors.
 
Learn Microsoft Graph Toolkit interactively
To help you learn what Microsoft Graph Toolkit has to offer and how you'd use it in your app, we recently released a new learning path on Microsoft Learn. By following a few learn modules you'll learn everything that you need to know to use the toolkit in your app. But that's not all.
Thinking about the different ways in which people learn, we've launched an experiment - an interactive code tour that you can follow to add Microsoft Graph Toolkit to a React app.

 

 
By following the instructions in the tour, you gradually extend an empty React app with Microsoft Graph Toolkit turning it into a true Microsoft 365 app. What's cool about this code tour, is that it puts the code of your app in the center. Rather than reading long-form, you're in the code and get relevant, and in-place tips for building your app.
 
The Microsoft Graph Toolkit React code tour is a great way to quickly experience how you'd use the toolkit in a React app. We'd love it if you gave it a try and told us what you think. Shall we consider building tours for other technologies and scenarios?

        <id>https://spring.io/blog/2022/10/13/spring-batch-5-0-0-m8-is-out</id>
        <link href="https://spring.io/blog/2022/10/13/spring-batch-5-0-0-m8-is-out"/>
        <updated>2022-10-13T08:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On behalf of the team and all contributors, I am pleased to announce that Spring Batch 5.0.0-M8 is now available from our milestone repository.

In this milestone, we introduced two main changes:


  
New default execution context serialization format

  
SystemCommandTasklet enhancements


This blog post walks through these two major changes in details. For the complete list of changes,
please check the release notes.
New default execution context serialization format

In this milestone release, the DefaultExecutionContextSerializer was updated to serialize/deserialize the context to/from Base64.

Moreover, the default ExecutionContextSerializer configured by @EnableBatchProcessing or DefaultBatchConfiguration was changed from JacksonExecutionContextStringSerializer to DefaultExecutionContextSerializer. The dependency to Jackson was made optional. In order to use the JacksonExecutionContextStringSerializer, jackson-core should be added to the classpath.
SystemCommandTasklet enhancements

The SystemCommandTasklet has been revisited in this release and was changed as follows:


  

  
A new strategy interface named CommandRunner was introduced in order to decouple the command execution from the tasklet execution. The default implementation is the JvmCommandRunner which uses the java.lang.Runtime#exec API to run system commands. This interface can be implemented to use any other API to run system commands.

  

  
The method that runs the command now accepts an array of Strings representing the command and its arguments. There is no need to tokenize the command or do any pre-processing anymore. This change makes the API more intuitive, and less prone to errors.


Feedback

I would like to thank all contributors who had a role in this release! As we continue
our work on Spring Batch 5, we look forward to your feedback on Github, Twitter and StackOverflow.

We believe that the interconnection between metrics, logging, and distributed tracing gives you the ability to reason about the state of your system in order to debug exceptions and latency in your applications. You can watch more about what we think observability is in this episode of Enlightning with Jonatan Ivanov.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Communication between a client application and an Azure Service Bus namespace is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS is a standard cryptographic protocol that ensures privacy and data integrity between clients and services over the Internet. For more information about TLS, see Transport Layer Security.
 
Azure Service Bus supports choosing a specific TLS version for namespaces. Currently Azure Service Bus uses TLS 1.2 on public endpoints by default, but TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are still supported for backward compatibility.
 
Azure Service Bus namespaces permit clients to send and receive data with TLS 1.0 and above. To enforce stricter security measures, you can configure your Service Bus namespace to require that clients send and receive data with a newer version of TLS. If a Service Bus namespace requires a minimum version of TLS, then any requests made with an older version will fail. 
 
Thanks to your input and feedback, this feature is now in general availability.

This is accomplished through two new features we are releasing in public preview. They will be available in East US and South-Central US soon, around Ignite timeframe, with more regions following.
 
First, we are releasing scaling partitions, which allows the use of partitioning for the premium messaging tier in public preview. This means that the overall throughput of a partitioned entity is no longer limited by the performance of a single message broker. Additionally, a temporary outage of a message broker, for example during an upgrade, doesn't render a partitioned queue or topic unavailable, as messages will be retried on a different partition.

Prometheus, the open-source project from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, is considered the de-facto standard when it comes to monitoring containerized workloads. Running self-managed Prometheus is often a great solution for smaller deployments but scaling this to handle enterprise workloads can be a challenge. 
 
Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus brings the best of what you like about the open-source ecosystem while automating complex tasks such as scaling, high-availability, and long-term data retention. It is available to use as its own feature from Azure Monitor or as an integrated component with Azure Monitor container insights and Azure Managed Grafana.

However, as users migrate large scale workloads to containers, they often create a large number of AKS clusters for various reasons – clusters in different environments (QA/test, staging, prod), clusters in different regions for high availability or localization/proximity, or using clusters to achieve strong isolation between workloads.

Modern applications run on complex environments using a plethora of cloud services, and it can take days—if not weeks—for developers to get access to the resources they need. On top of that, organizations lack centralized visibility into environments, making it hard to ensure they run securely and in compliance with corporate policies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Java Profiler for Azure Monitor Application Insights is now in Public Preview. It is a new capability in Azure Monitor to help Java developers troubleshoot performance issues and uncover performance bottlenecks. 
  
Under the hood, it uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to profile your application using a customized configuration.  For additional context, JFR is a tool that collects profiling data of running Java applications, and it is integrated into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). JFR comes with little to barely noticeable overhead cost which makes it great to run on heavily loaded production deployments. 
  
Using the customized configuration, you can generate profiles in two ways: 
  

Automated Profiling - Configure CPU and memory thresholds to automatically trigger a profile recording. 
On-demand Profiling - Use “Profile Now” to run near real-time profile recording. 

 To try out the Java Profiler:
 

Enable Azure Monitor Application Insights using v3.4.1 jar file or later. 
Enable the profiler using the java profiler installation guidance and set your CPU/Memory triggers for automatic profiling. 
Click the "Profiler" button on the Application Insights Performance Blade and click "Profile Now" for an on-demand profile. 
Download the profiling session when it becomes available (it may take about 5 minutes to show up in Portal). 
View and analyze the profile with Java Mission Control (JMC) or another tool (java profiles are not currently viewable in Portal). 

  

 
  
Java Profiling is in preview today and can be enabled across all your JVMs. Even better, it is included in Application Insights for no additional cost. Try it out and let us know what you think!]]></summary>

To prevent bad actors from accessing or disrupting sensitive data as it moves through the internet, we have relied on various cryptographic protocols over the years, namely Secure Socket Layers (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS). As weaknesses were discovered, new versions of SSL and then TLS were created and although technologies have evolved, so have the tactics of hackers and other cyber criminals.

Spring fans, our annual survey of the Spring community is back! Last year, we dived into the biggest projects and the most popular app patterns built with Spring, and a whole lot more! You told us your views about Spring Native, Data, and what matters to you when you start using a new Spring project.

The survey is back for 2022, and we’re really excited to learn again from you. What matters to you when you build with Spring? What types of apps are you building with Spring? What can we change, and what should remain the same?

Completing the survey should take about 15 minutes. If you want to be among the first to get the report, feel free to leave your email at the end of the survey.

Ok, if you’re ready, head over to spring.io/survey now!

One last thing - we’d really appreciate it if you share the survey with others in the Spring community. You can share the link spring.io/survey, or our Twitter and LinkedIn posts. Thank you!

Sometimes, we may encounter the following error when accessing wordpress website.
 

 
It is very easy to understand that there is something wrong with the connection between the website and database. But how can we find more detailed information regarding this error?
 
We can enable WordPress debugging mode to check the detailed error message. The steps are as below.
 
1.Login to the newui of the scm site.(https://{sitename}.scm.azurewebsites.net/newui)
2.Click File Manager and find the wp-config.php file under site/wwwroot folder.
 

  
3.Change "define( 'WP_DEBUG', false);" to "define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );" in wp-config.php file. We can edit it directly from the newui portal.
 
With this change, you can try to access the wordpress site again without restarting the app service. You will see the detailed error message when accessing the website.

 
You may see below possible error messages. I added some suggestions for each kind of error for your reference.
 
Error 1: mysqli_real_connect(): (HY000/1045): Access denied for user 'gyomnlmsxk1'@'10.0.0.254' (using password: YES) in /home/site/wwwroot/wp-includes/wp-db.php on line 1753
         Access denied for user 'gyomnlmsxk1'@'10.0.0.254' (using password: YES)

Suggestion: Check if the server url is correct. If the server url is correct, check if there is any network limitation between website and database.
 
Error 3: Unknown database 'tonywordpr_83b28fe8295b4846ef6d475eecee129_database'

Quick recap of the Hub & Spoke
 
I won't spend much time on this because, most of you already know what the Hub & Spoke model is all about. Microsoft has already documented this here, although the proposed diagram is a little bit naïve, but the essentials are there. The Hub & Spoke model, is a network-centric architecture where everything ends up in a virtual network in a way or another. This gives companies a greater control over the network traffic. There are many variants, but the spokes are virtual networks dedicated to business workloads, while the hubs play a control role, m…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're a web developer, there's an exciting opportunity for you to build applications for Microsoft 365, which many organizations across the world use for work. Let me show you, how you can use your existing skills and build your first application that integrates with Microsoft 365 in just 10 minutes.
 
What's Microsoft 365?
Microsoft 365 is a set of applications, like Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Word, or SharePoint, that organizations use for work. Every day, millions of people use Microsoft 365 to chat, meet, send emails, create documents, and more.
 
But Microsoft 365 isn't just a set of apps. It's also a platform that enables developers, like yourself, to build applications. These apps can tap into data and insights stored on Microsoft 365 and bring them into people's workflows.
 
Building for a platform
Building for a platform isn't trivial. It comes with all kinds of specific knowledge you have to have like what tooling, SDKs, and APIs to use, how to integrate your app, and finally how to package and distribute it. What many people forget though, is that you don't have to learn everything about everything at once. Often, you can start simple and build up from there.
 
Build your first Microsoft 365 app in just 10 minutes
Recently, I published an article on freeCodeCamp that shows you how you can build your first Microsoft 365 app in just 10 minutes.

 

 
Sure, the app is simple and doesn't do much, but when building it, you'll learn the fundamental concepts of building apps on Microsoft 365. And after these 10 minutes, you'll have a functional app that works and retrieves data from Microsoft 365, and which you can use as a starting point for more complex apps.
 
Give it a try, and we're looking forward to hearing what you think.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overview
In this How To, I will show a simple mechanism for reading items from CosmosDB using Azure API Management (APIM). Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed, serverless NoSQL database for high-performance applications of any size or scale. APIM is a API management service offering many features for manging APIs and exposing backend services.
 
Example Use Case
The example use case involves using CosmosDB to maintain a list of information and exposing the information using APIM as a public RSS feed. This will provide a user to illustrate APIM caching and transformation, and how APIM can call CosmosDB securely using managed identity.
 
Setup
The first step is to provision a CosmosDB and APIM service instance. In my resource group, I created the following services:

The main theme of this milestone is the improvement of job parameters handling in Spring Batch. Two main changes were introduced in this release:


  
Add support to use any type as a job parameter

  
Improve job parameters conversion


This blog post walks through these two major changes in details. For the complete list of changes, please check the release notes.
Add support to use any type as a job parameter

Up to version 4, Spring Batch supported only 4 types that can be used as job parameters, which are long, double, String and Date. While this was convenient to simplify job parameters handling on the framework’s side, it turns out t…]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-10-05T02:50:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scenario
Goal: Blob storage can access only from the app service.So, you want to set the blob storage firewall for inbound traffic.
 
Blob storage firewall limitation in this scenario
1. IP address
 IP network rules have no effect on requests originating from the same Azure region as the storage account.
 See Grant access from an internet IP range 
2. Service tag
 There isn't an App service tag.

 
ps. When clients request blob storage through app service, blob storage receives not App service IP but Client IP.
 
Workaround
1. Add IP address when app service and storage are located in a different region.
When resources are located in a different region, the IP address firewall setting works.
2. Firewall with Virtual Network
When blob storage uses VNet firewall, app service must be integrated with VNet.
If you want to read what is VNet integration, see VNet integration 

 
Before setting VNet integration, you must check limitations.
Integrate your app with an Azure virtual network - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn
 
1. Set Vnet Integration on the app service
Add VNet to your app service.
I use "firwall-storage-vnet" VNet as below.
 

 
2. Blob storage firewall setting with VNet which is integrated with app service

3. If you use a function app, please add WEBSITE_CONTENTOVERVNET = 1
A value of 1 enables your function app to scale when you have your storage account restricted to a virtual network. 
You can see the detail about this setting website_contentovervnet]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Static Web Apps automatically builds and deploys dozens of frontend frameworks, one of them is Nuxt. Today, we're excited to share that you can deploy Nuxt 3 applications with universal rendering to Azure Static Web Apps.
 
While Nuxt 2 is known for its ease of use, Nuxt 3 brings even faster performance and improved developer experience with a thrilling new set of underlying technologies and features. With the release of Nuxt 3’s release candidate in April 2022, developers witnessed a complete re-architect of the framework. Nuxt 2 apps that have been upgraded with Nuxt Bridge also work with Azure Static Web Apps.
 
What’s new in Nuxt 3? 
 

Zero-configuration deployment of Nuxt 3 and Nuxt Bridge applications with universal rendering to Azure Static Web Apps 
API routes support for automatic generation from server API and middleware directories 
Vue 3 support including composition API with imported functions for better code re-usability 
Nitro Engine, a full stack server that allows deployment of output on Node.js, serverless, edge-side rendering, or as static 
Vite, a frontend tooling that features fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimizes assets for production 

Universal rendering vs static rendering
 
Previously, you were able to deploy a static rendered Nuxt app on Azure Static Web Apps, where the entire app is pre-generated as static content. However, Nuxt 3 also supports universal rendering, which provides the performance and search engine optimization of server-side rendering while still enabling client-side interactivity.
 
With Nuxt 3's support for Azure Static Web Apps, you can now deploy sites with universal rendering. 
 
To learn more, check out the Nuxt 3 site deployment with universal rendering on Azure Static Web Apps documentation that also includes a tutorial.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For Azure Functions -
 

Adaptive sampling is enabled by default.
Fixed-rate sampling is not supported.
Ingestion sampling only applies when no other sampling is in effect. Therefore, this is also disabled by default in the wake of point #1 above.

 
 
If you expect data (invocations) under Monitor but do not find it as shown in screenshot below, you have either changed Host.Results category to Warning (or above) level; or your application telemetry is getting sampled. To fix the former, open Host.json file and change the Host.Results category to Information level.
 
{
  "logging": {
    "fileLoggingMode": "always",
    "logLevel": {
      "default": "Information",
      "Host.Results": "Information",
      "Function": "Error",
      "Host.Aggregator": "Trace"
    }
  }
}
 
 
If Host.Results category is already set at Information level, disable telemetry sampling as the next step.
 

 
 
 
To disable the sampling, set "isEnabled": false in host.json file as shown below -
 
{
  "logging": {
    "applicationInsights": {
      "samplingSettings": {
        "isEnabled": false
       }
    }
  }
}
 
After disabling sampling, you can confirm it by running a query similar to the following; RetainedPercentage should show 100%.
 

 
 
 
 
At this point, the function invocations should start appearing under Monitor on Azure Portal UI.]]></summary>

Node.js has two module systems:
1)  CommonJS modules and
2)  ECMAScript modules.
 
1) CommonJS: The de facto standard for modules in Node.js currently  is CommonJS. CommonJS modules are defined in normal .js files using module.exports or .cjs.
Modules can be used later within other .js files with the require() function.
Import using require (Common JS) :
 
// foo.js
module.exports = function() {
  return 'Hello foo!';
}

// index.js
var foo = require('./foo');
console.log(foo()); // Hello foo!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Running Terraform locally in Windows along with the Azure CLI gives you a bit more flexibility in large corporates due to eliminating the need to connect to Azure Cloud Shell from VS Code, which in itself can be a challenge with things like conditional access which may block authentication from remote locations where Azure Cloud Shell runs from. 
 
To get things setup remotely, you need a few things. 
 
Five easy steps:

Install Terraform locally
Install Bash (optional)

Can use PowerShell or the Command Prompt


Install the Azure CLI
Setup the Terraform State in Azure Blob Storage
Sign into Azure CLI from VS Code

Writing happy-path business logic isn’t the hard part! It’s the failure cases, observability, resilience, and process. It’s security and other so-called non-functional requirements. It’s architecting for agility. It’s production. Spring is unique because it sits at the crossroads of many exciting application development discussions. 

Spring’s community contains multitudes and is one of the key defining features. This diversity of discussion means that any conference that endeavors to cover the full sweep of ideas has its work cut out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m pleased to announce the first milestone release of Spring for GraphQL 1.1.0 is now available from our Milestone repository. This version will be shipped with Spring Boot 3.0.0-M5 due for release later this week.

Spring Boot 3.0 is around the corner and the community is expecting a compatible Spring for GraphQL version to go with it. Currently, the best way to prepare for the Spring Boot 3.0 upgrade is to upgrade to Spring Boot 2.7 and Java 17, but Spring Boot 3.0 has new baseline requirements, namely Java 17, Jakarta APIs and Spring Framework 6.0.

Given that Spring for GraphQL 1.0.0 was released towards the end of May this year, we didn’t feel we would have enough time nor feedback to go with a major release of the project for Boot 3.0. This is why the goal of the 1.1 release is simply to adapt to the new baseline requirements and provide a smooth upgrade to Spring Boot 3.0 for existing projects.

This first milestone brings those foundational changes: the Java 17, Jakarta APIs, and a Spring Framework 6.0 baseline. We’re also taking the opportunity to upgrade to GraphQL Java 19.x – a painless upgrade on our side, thanks to the GraphQL Java team! We’ve also replaced our internally developed context propagation mechanism with the new Micrometer Context Propagation library, that’s intended for use broadly across Spring projects. It allows Spring applications to propagate context across various such mechanisms, e.g. ThreadLocal, Reactor Context, GraphQLContext, and others.

In the next milestones, we will consider how we can adapt our current arrangement with important themes in Spring Boot 3.0: GraalVM native image and Micrometer Observability support. Given the short timeline, we might schedule some changes for a future version – again, a smooth upgrade is our top priority here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can use client side decryption of properties on Azure Spring Apps by following the steps below:
Add the encrypted property in your .properties file in your git repository.It would look like:


message={cipher}f43e3df3862ab196a4b367624a7d9b581e1c543610da353fbdd2477d60fb282f


Update the Config Server on Azure Spring App to use the git repository which has our encrypted property. You could do it directly from Azure Portal or use Azure CLI:
az spring-cloud config-server git set -n myspringcloud --uri <git_repo_url>

In your Spring Boot application, add the decryption key in the bootstrap.yml file. (You would need to create it if it does not exist)


encrypt:
  key: somerandomkey



[This is the key you would have used in order to encrypt your property earlier]Now, add some code to get the value of the encrypted property.


package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class TestController {

    @Value("${message:default}") 
    String message;

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String hello() {
        return message;
    }

}



Create an App, or deploy to an existing one.
az spring-cloud app create -n <appName>

 
Deploy your app.
az spring-cloud app deploy -n appName --jar-path <location_of_jar>

 
Assign a public endpoint (or use the Test Endpoints)
az spring-cloud app update -n appName --assign-endpoint true

 
Access your application to view the value.
https://<myspringcloud>-<appName>.azuremicroservices.io/

 
(Optional) You can check the encrypted values on the Config Server by following the steps mentioned in thisdocumentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-cloud/how-to-access-data-plane-azure-ad-rbac]]></summary>

In this How To, I will show a simple mechanism for writing a payload to Azure Blob Storage from Azure API Management (APIM). Some examples where this approach is useful:

Claim-CheckClaim-Check pattern is used to split a large message into a claim check and a payload. The claim check is sent to a downstream system which has a reference to the location of the payload. The downstream system then retrieves the payload for handling. You might want to do this when working with technology that are not optimised suited for very large messages (Service Bus) either by a size limitation or associated cost, or when you do not need to process all messages.

Key 5G characteristics such as very low latency, coverage of large and broad areas, high bandwidth, and very importantly as a differentiator versus Wi-Fi, QoS, reliability, security, slicing, and even network APIs to interact with the network from your apps make those new scenarios possible.
 
We’re excited to share this Infographic or “cheat sheet” we created explaining the key topics related to 5G, fundamental characteristics of 5G, new possible topologies (5G Private MEC and 5G Public MEC), and some details and elements of a simplified 5G architecture when using 5G with Azure Private MEC solution.

In a previous post, we introduced the isolated process model, which decouples your function code from the core Azure Functions host, in contrast to the traditional model where we run them together in the same process. Functions V4 supports .NET 6 in both models, and the isolated process model also supports .NET 7 (public preview) and Framework 4.8 (public preview). In this update, we’ll re-cap some of our recent updates, outline some changes to look forward to, and expand on our thinking about future versions.

Network with community members and peers to learn about the latest Java innovations on Kubernetes.  It's a free, one-day online event, so attend a few sessions or stay on for the whole thing. 
 
Join us for a full day of sessions, including those presented my Microsoft Java product and Advocate teams, to help you gain valuable industry insights and vital job skills from the Java-4-Kubernetes community experts.
 
Microsoft's event schedule includes:

What's up at Eclipse Adoptium? -- by George Adams
Take the suckage out of Microservices with Container Apps -- by Rory Preddy
Secrets of Performance Tuning Java on Kubernetes -- by Bruno Borges
Deploying to Spring boot apps to Kubernetes with GitHub Actions and feature flags -- by Brian Benz and Stephanie Crater

 

 
This year's keynote by Mark Little, VP of Engineering at Red Hat, will be on "Transactional Microservices in Kube-native Manner" where he dives into the role it place in distributed computing, which is not necessarily the kind of transaction developers typically use. Quarkus and Eclipse MicroProfile are examples of what this looks like today.
 
Special guest speaker, Lasada Pippen is a ground up, self-established engineering and technologist who now inspires people to overcome odds and face difficulties to pursue your dreams. For J4K, he will talk about "Hidden Gems" that you are and how to make cloud companies recognize this. Lasada will help you identify how valuable you are even if you're not being immediately recognized, how to navigate through this, and overcome hurdles to harness your success.
 
This is a once-a-year event with over two dozen sessions, exciting keynotes, and lots of learnings. So, what do you have to lose? Register for free and join the Java on Kubernetes community on September 28, 2022. Reserve your seat now.]]></summary>

Our goal back then was to give developers the flexibility to build, deploy, and scale web apps and APIs on their own terms, regardless of price. Today, we remain just as committed to that goal—and are doubling down on our commitment to improving and growing the free tier alongside our premium offerings.

Create your keys using the following command on your terminal


ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096 -C "test@mymail.com"



This will create a public key (.pub) and a private key.
Copy the public key on GitHub
Go to your GitHub account -> Settings -> SSH and GPG keys Click on New SSH key and copy the public key here.
Configure the Config Server on Azure Spring Apps
Go to the Azure Spring Apps Service -> Config ServerSpecify the GitHub URL, Label etc. and choose SSH as the Authentication protocol. Copy your private key in the text box and save.

(Optional) To ensure that the key works, you can test it on the local system as well.
Refer: Clone GitHub Repository using SSH


eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

ssh-add <private key>

git clone <GIT_URL>
#Example of the URL: git@github.com:username/testconfig.git

However, one important factor that can be overlooked is that the test system itself needs to be running smoothly - otherwise the accuracy of your test results will be compromised!
 
While running a load test in Azure Load Testing you might wonder if you’ve configured the correct number threads (users) in your Apache JMeter script. A thread runs through a transaction from start to finish, and then repeats until the test is over. You may notice that a test runs successfully with a lower number of threads, but the test may fail with errors once you increase the load.

They make it easy to introduce stateful components to your app without needing to manually persist data to external storage, so you can focus on your business logic.

While I’m positive I’m not the first person to ask this, I think it’s an appropriate way for us to kick off this article: “How many developers does it take to define cloud native?”
 
I hope you aren’t waiting for a punch line because I seriously want to know your thoughts. Drop your perspectives in the comments...but if you ask me, the limit does not exist!
 
A quick online search of the topic returns a laundry list of articles, e-books, twitter threads, etc. all trying to nail down the one true definition.

If you used R in your data science project, to fit a predictive model able to produce the most accurate prediction possible for new data, you have probably experimented with tidymodels. However, questions like “what is the tidyverse” or “how does the tidymodels framework fit in it” might still have no clear answer for you.
 
What is the tidyverse
The simplest way to describe the tidyverse is as a collection of R packages - sharing common ideas and norms - designed to perform data science tasks easily and quickly. But I don’t like this definition too much because it tends to be too simplistic. Tidyverse is more than that: it’s a philosophy or a lifestyle embodied in …]]></summary>

Symptom
Connection from the 2012R2 on-prem Windows server to the AKS would fail, with the error message: 

 
Troubleshooting

Capture the network trace, and you will find Encrypted Alert during the TLS handshake:


2. Note that the handshake would fail immediately after the client hello. This means TLS handshake fails to establish, and most often it's due to the server and client does not have common cipher suites to exchange.

Along the way we've covered federated credentials, managed identity, EasyAuth and more. It has been neatly packaged into CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions as well for further streamlining. I'm happy with the results so far even though some of it took quite the effort to pull off.

It is a tutorial to reproduce such the scenario.
 
STEP 1: In Azure portal, create a new Premium python Function App and a Service Bus + Queue
 
STEP 2: Download the sample code and apply some changes.
https://cchlab.blob.core.windows.net/cchlab/cchlabsbf.zip
In "host.json", please specify the Function App timeout and the ServiceBus PeekLock timeout as below.

In "ServiceBusQueueTrigger1/function.json", please setup some configuration:
SBQ_STRING=<your service bus queue name>

Then, deploy the project to Function App.
 
STEP 3: Making an experiment with a short execution time.

Please specify the "DurationInSecond" to 30 this time, and you may see the result like this:

We apply this operation to send a message to the ServiceBus queue and told the ServiceBus trigger to pause 30 seconds before execution.
Now, please go to the monitor page:

You can see it is just a normal short invocation.
 
STEP 4: Making an experiment with a long execution time.
Visit: https://<YourAppName>.azurewebsites.net/api/httptrigger1?t=<DurationInSecond>
Please specify the "DurationInSecond" to 330 this time, and you may see the result like this:

Now, please go to the monitor page:

As you can see, there are duplicate invocations with the same message id, which might caused some potential business issues if we ignore them.
 
Conclusion:
Since we cannot adjust "maxAutoRenewDuration" to more than 5 minutes, we could only reduce the execution time from this ServiceBus trigger.]]></summary>

This is a chart that is mostly used in project management visually representing projection timelines for the project and the tasks. This is a tool that clearly outlines tasks and to which teams they have been assigned to. This helps you to manage the whole project in an efficient manner by taking note of the projection timeline. You get to keep everyone on the same page from product managers, program managers, business analyst, developers etc.
The main advantage of working with a Gantt Chart is that you get to plan, schedule, and execute your projects on just one chart. The other cool thing is you can track the progress by what has been completed, what is going on and upcoming tasks.

First, a client makes a network request to the Gateway

  
The Gateway is defined with a number of routes, each with Predicates to match the request to the route. For example, you can match on the path segment of the URL or the HTTP method of the request.

  
Once matched, the Gateway executes pre-request logic on each of the filters applied to the route. For example, you might want to add query parameters to your request

  
A proxy filter routes the request to the proxied service

  
The service executes and returns a response

  
The gateway receives the response and executes post-request logic on each filter before return…]]></summary>

One of the obvious benefits of open, cloud-based technologies is the ability to integrate a wide range of global services with on-premises resources. If you’ve developed for financial services for any length of time, you know this openness adds another level of complexity to development. When money movement is involved, you’re going to encounter a higher level of risk and compliance considerations.
This blog highlights just such an issue encountered by the DevStudio engineering team here at Fiserv, and how we solved it. I hope this blog helps you understand not only how our team works but gives you useful context for implementing your own solutions that prioritize security and compliance without sacrificing speed or functionality.

Now that we are well acquainted with power apps and creating a microsoft graph custom connector in it, let us familiarize ourselves with the following terms once so that we can proceed to call Microsoft graph API in Power Automate using custome connectors for which we will require to set the criteria in authentication.
 
Azure API Management Gateway
Custom connectors are supported by Microsoft Azure API Management infrastructure. When a connection to the underlying API is created, the API Management gateway stores the API credentials or tokens, depending on the type of authentication used, on a per-connection basis in a token store. This solution enables authentication at the connection level.

To create a Microsoft Graph custom connector in Power Apps, let us get acquainted with some important terms first.
 
What are Power Apps?

Power Apps is a suite of apps, services, connectors, and a data platform, that provides a rapid development environment to build custom apps for business needs.
Using Power Apps, one can quickly build custom business apps that connect to data stored either in the underlying data platform (Microsoft Dataverse) or in various online and on-premises data sources (such as SharePoint, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, SQL Server).
One can create three types of apps using this service: canvas, model-driven, and portal.

GitHub classroom is great, and it lets educators create automatic grading solution with GitHub Actions. However, one of the pitfall is that students can easily change the unit test codes and GitHub actions workflow and educators cannot trust the automatic grading result. Another problem is that students must commit and push source code themselves. Educators therefore have no idea if students are copying from other or not. Also, educators don’t know how students develop their answer, and the details of every code change. 
Solution
To solve the potential cheating problem and to move from passive to active learning, we need a source of truth to run unit test and keep all changes of source codes when students are writing codes.

Throughout this series we've been exploring many different aspects of using GraphQL in Azure, but it's always been from the perspective of creating a new API. While there are a certain class of problems which support you starting from scratch, it's not uncommon to have an existing API that you're bound to, and in that case, GraphQL might not be as easy to tackle.
Here's a scenario that I want to put forth, you've got an existing API, maybe it's REST, maybe it's a bespoke HTTP API, none the less you're building a new client in which you want to consume the endpoint as GraphQL. We could go down the path of creating an Apollo Server and using the RESTDataSource, or using HotChocolate's REST support, but for both of these…]]></summary>

What role does simplicity play when architecting solutions?
Simplicity is like a philosophy or a pervasive thread that you often have to revisit at every stage. From an architecture perspective you can visualize the way these solutions might fit together and then you ask yourself whether it's as simple as it needs to be or is it overly complex or can it be reduced further.  Ask yourself if you are providing too many knobs and bell…]]></summary>

        <link href="https://spring.io/blog/2022/08/10/spring-web-flow-3-0-m1-released"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been almost 4 years since the last set of Spring Web Flow releases. Nevertheless, the project continues to serve a specific need particularly well, arguably better than alternatives, and remains in active use. While there hasn’t been a strong driver for new releases, the upcoming Spring Framework 6 brings a Java 17 baseline and makes the shift to Jakarta EE, which creates the need for such a release in order to enable applications to migrate to this new baseline.

Today I’m pleased to announce the availability of Spring Web Flow 3.0 M1 in the Spring milestone repository. This release focuses mainly on compatibility with Spring Framework 6 and Jakarta EE. The Travel booking-mvc sample on spring-projects/spring-webflow-samples has been updated and the commit history provides example changes. One significant change is the need to remove Tiles which has not migrated to Jakarta EE. In the sample, Thymeleaf Layouts is used instead.

Note that Spring Faces is not included in the release due to its deep integration with JSF and the additional time and effort required to migrate. Please, reach out if you have experience with Web Flow and JSF and are interested to help out with the migration of Spring Faces to Spring Framework 6 and Jakarta EE.

If you have a Web Flow application and you plan to migrate to Spring Framework 6, please give this milestone a try and provide feedback through the project issue tracker. Special thanks to Ian Young and Scott Cantor for their substantial contributions to this release!]]></summary>

In this article we would like to dive deep into the concepts of “Migrate” and “Modernize”, explain what they mean to us, what they mean to customers, and what the tradeoffs between them are.
 
Read to the end for links to useful resources that can help support you in your choice of whether you should modernize or migrate parts of your application portfolio.
 
Defining the concepts
 
Cloud migration is the process of moving applications, infrastructure, and data from one location, often a company’s private, on-site ("on-premises") datacenter to a public cloud provider’s infrastructure.  Migrating an on-premises physical or virtual server…]]></summary>

What is Low code and why do we care?
Low code development is using blocks instead of specific code to build apps and services. There are many Low Code platforms, Microsoft's is called Microsoft Power Platform.
The reason these platforms exist is that there's a great need to build business apps and not enough developers to build them. Also, many times non developer sit on business expertise, and it takes time to convey all they know to developers.
With a low code platform, you can empower t…]]></summary>

Azure networking can sometimes give headaches. Here are a few tips which may make your life easier.
 
1. Private link effect - episode 1 - route tables
 
When enabling Azure Private Link for a given resource, say a Storage Account, you may end up with the following configuration
 

where you have routed all traffic to Azure Firewall (or an NVA) and noticed that the VM (or anything else) is directly connecting to the private endpoint, bypassing the firewall...This might come as a surprise to you but this is due to the fact that whenever you enable private link for a given resource, a direct (more specific) route is propagated to the underlying NICs. In the above example, Azure will write the 10.1.5.4/32 route to the NIC(s) of the VM pointing directly to the InterfaceEndpoint of the re…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background  
The Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a management platform that you can use to manage your IT and development infrastructure with configuration as code. The Azure Desired State Configuration (DSC) extension helps bootstrap a VM to the Azure Automation State Configuration (DSC) service. The DSC extension can be installed on Azure VMs as a Virtual Machine Extension.  The DSCForLinux extension installs the OMI and DSC agent on Azure virtual machines.  
  
Over the past year, our team has been developing Automatic Extension Upgrade which now supports the DSC extension. When Automatic Extension Upgrade for the DSC extension is enabled on a VM, the extension is upgraded automatically whenever Microsoft releases a new version for the extension. You can do this by simply setting the flag to true via API, CLI or PowerShell as documented here.  
   
Security Recommendations  
We strongly recommend enabling automatic updates for the DSC extension as soon as possible. This update ensures that customers get important security or performance updates to the extension as soon as possible without manual overhead.  
   
As always, we welcome feedback from customers and partners which supports our efforts to continuously harden our products and services. We want to thank the Wiz team for their collaboration and commitment to helping make Azure customers more secure.]]></summary>

Ingestion latency signals measure the time it takes for an event to be reported, processed and become available for search in your logs data store. You can read more about how we calculate the latency and what can influence data latency time.
 
Query success percentage measures the number of queries that return a non-Http5XX - for example, when a query completes successfully or fails with user-side errors. This number does not include queries initiated by Azure log search Alerts or Azure Sentinel. This signal will be available via Resource health in the near future.

Docker for Local Development
 
Local development with Docker enables developers to work faster, setting up complex development environments quickly, with short, simple commands, and taking them down as required. It enables the development process to continue seamlessly without the overhead of bloating development machines with several versions of software frameworks, DBMS, or other kind of development dependencies.

Even if you don’t expect as many users as requests per second, it’s important to discover your application’s breakpoint and verify that your application can recover without a lot of effort.

Earlier this year we started an effort align the project with latest Spring Boot and Spring Framework versions as it was difficult to use existing Spring Shell release of a spring family.

Originally the main issue we wanted to address was a removal of a bean cycles which Spring Boot is now enforcing by default. While this feature can be turned off it is not something Spring Shell should require. This required a lot of changes and we chose to handle it with rework of a shell interna…]]></summary>

Abstract
This article describes how to protect a complex application with multiple components (like CloudBees CI - Jenkins) on Azure Kubernetes Service against disasters like the complete loss of an Azure region with NetApp® Astra™ Control Service. We demonstrate how to protect a CloudBees deployment using multiple Jenkins instances with snapshots and backups and recover the entire application to a different Azure region in case of a disaster.

Use containers for platform independence
 
An application that runs in a container behaves the same, wherever you run it. That's because the container provides a stable infrastructure environment that doesn't change. You just take it to wherever you want to run it. 

This also enables you to run self-contained applications that do not rely on a runtime, like the Java runtime, to be installed on its host. And this experience is enhanced with cloud-based management and features when you run your containers in a service like Azure Kubernetes Service.

In this post, we'll containerize a Java application, push it to Azure Container Registry, and run it in Azure Kubernetes Service.

How is the architecture for mission critical apps different than for other apps?
We'd like there to be a consistent set of architectural principles for everything from the small to the large, but in general, when you're building mission critical applications, we need to think about things in terms of those uber important architectural patterns and system characteristics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first step is to create an Azure Service Principal account. You'll need the following:
 

An Azure subscription ID (find it here) or follow this guide.
A Service Principal with the following details the AppID, password, and tenant information. Create one with:
 az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "CICD" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID --sdk-auth
Replace "$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID" with the id from step 1.

Next, in your GitHub repository, add the output from the Service Principal (should be a JSON blob) as an Action Secret. You do this in your repository Settings.
 
Finally, create a GitHub workflow file by going to the "Actions" tab. Make sure you use the Azure login action:
 - uses: azure/login@v1   with:     creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
 
The full running example is in the sample GitHub repository which you can use to get started, or use the YouTube video for a detailed walk-through!

This week I’m writing you from sunny Seattle, Washington, where we’re having our next installment of the SpringOne Tour series. It’s been a ton of fun seeing all these fun and friendly faces again and getting to see people, many of whom I haven’t seen since before the pandemic! I’ve also had a lot of fun seeing some friends from some of the big cloud companies here, Microsoft and AWS. It’s always interesting to learn how people are using the latest and greatest from Spring to build amazing systems and software targeting these cloud platforms.

We’ve got a lot to cover this week so let’s dive right into it!


  
In last week’s podcast, I talked to Kubernetes contributor and fellow Tanzu Developer Advocate Leigh Capili

  
Distributed Tracing With OpenTelemetry, Spring Cloud Sleuth, Kafka, and Jaeger

  
Ingress vs. Load Balancer in Kubernetes

  
Instantiating Multiple Beans of the Same Class with Spring Annotations

  
Curious about when and why to use Java 14 Records vs. Lombok? Check out this article

  
I put together this little example , thanks to Reactor lead Simon Baslé, showing how to handle pagination with the expand operator in Project Reactor: Pagination in a Reactive Application. It looks at how to eleganrly expand the contents of a reactive stream as new data (in a data pagination scenario) becomes available.

  
Spring Shell 2.1.0-RC1 is now available

  
Pushing a Docker Image to a Self-Hosted Registry

  
Spring for Apache Kafka 2.9 Release Candidate Available

  
This Apache Maven Survival Guide is quite interesting, to me at least!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the main missing pieces for the Compose spec support in az containerapp compose was support for the build key.
 
With the 0.2.0 release, there is now support for the build key.  The container image build is handled by Azure Container Registry, so you can either provide ACR credentials or a new container registry will be created for you as part of the creation process.  Only context and dockerfile are currently supported.  
 
Example Compose File for a .NET Web Api project:
 
 
 
 
version: '3'
services:
  api:
    build:
      context: ./src
      dockerfile: ./TodoApi/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 8080:80
 
 
 
 
Example Repository Layout:
 

 
Example Command:
 
 
 
cd dotnet_api
az group create --name dotnet_api_example --location eastus
az containerapp compose create \
            --environment dotnetaca \
            --resource-group dotnet_api_example

At the end of every event or project, one of the key things you would want to receive is feedback. How was the event? Is there any part of the event that needs to be changed? If the feedback is given during the event, it is easy to respond and act on the feedback. However, most feedback is received after the event has happened. How do you gauge the different sentiments from the feedback and automate feedback response? In this session, we will create an end-to-end solution using Power Platform and Azure Cognitive Services to detect sentiments and respond to feedback proactively.

        <updated>2022-07-07T16:18:55.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am pleased to announce that the release candidate Spring for Apache Kafka 2.9.0 is now available (2.9.0-RC1) in the Spring Milestone Repo.



This version is not provided by Spring Boot dependency management, but it can be used with Boot 2.7, as long as you override the Kafka dependencies as described in this appendix, especially if you are using the embedded Kafka broker.



Notable Changes




This version uses the 3.2.0 kafka-clients version



Non-blocking retry bootstrapping is now more robust



New Error Handler Mode





By default, after an error, the DefaultErrorHandler performs seeks on the remaining records from the last poll and re-fetches them from the broker on the next poll.
With high error rates and large max.poll.records, this can cause unnecessary strain on the network.
For this reason, the error handler has a new property seekAfterError, when set to false, instead of seeking the records, the remaining records are retained in memory and the consumer paused for the next poll (or multiple polls if the error handler is configured to use the ContainerPausingBackOffHandler).





Pausing Containers





By default, when you pause() a container, it actually pauses when all the records from the previous poll have been processed.
This version adds the pauseImmediate container property, which, when true, causes the container to pause after the current record is processed.



For information about all changes in this release, see What’s New.

If you missed the session, here is what you need to catch up (Follow us on twitter to get notified of the upcoming activities):
Presentation content:

Microsoft University Recruiting in Africa
University Programs
Requirements for intern roles
Requirements for graduate roles
Application process
What University Recruiters are looking for
Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

Find the presentation deck here
These are some of the questions we received from the attendees, and below is the session recording with the recruiter’s responses and more:

What if you don’t have a degree but you have a diploma, do you have a chance for getting internship or full-time job?
A different recruiter once advised that you shouldn't have 'ratings' to the skills you have coz it may play against the applicant. Thoughts? 
Do self-taught developers stand a chance? 
What if your degree is not related to any tech-related course?

Note: This activity is a precursor to the Git & GitHub Technical workshop, where we will build websites to showcase our resumes. #GitHub.dev



Please let us know if you have any questions.

Let me take a step back here and explain. The built-in policies are great as a user-friendly way for implementing simple authentication use cases. A couple of clicks in the Azure Portal to create a policy, test it in the Portal as well, and send off a couple of parameters to the dev team to inject in their code and that's it. In theory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context
When you think of low code development, you think of inclusive technology as this introduces a visual approach (drag-drop) to developing software. Low code development empowers a citizen developer to quickly put together custom software solutions and increase focus on high-impact business operations. On the other hand, a code-first developer takes pride in writing code, working with source control - the traditional way of software development. But what happens when code-first developers need to contribute to the same project as citizen developers? Does this imply that either the code-first developers leave their area of comfort (dev environment) and fit into the citizen developer's world of low/no code and vice versa? Absolutely not!

But here in the US we just celebrated the 4th of July, and I, like many Americans, took a long weekend. Took some time with the family to do a little road trip up north to visit Mt. Shasta, Crater Lake, Lassen National Park, etc. It was a ton of fun, and a lot of driving! Anyway, it all kinda blurs together and felt like just one weekend, and today feels like Monday. I only just realized it was Tuesday! And you know what that means? It’s time for our weekly dive into the wild and wonderful world of Springdom!

"Show me what you can do by what you've done". This was the exact question one of my mentors asked me few years ago. I was so confident of my passion in data analysis, I had read and learnt a lot about the field but had no way to demonstrate my knowledge.
 
Let me summarize a 10-minute conversation with my mentor few years ago that led to a huge change in my career. It took me weeks to secure a 10-minute attention of my mentor to listen to my progress and all I have been able to do in the past few months. I approached my mentor with full confidence, spoke for 8 minutes on how much I knew about the evolving field of data analysis and science and that I believe I can start working in this field, his response was - "Show me what You can do by what You have done".

Scenario: You have different managers requesting to see the same KPIs (Customer Count, Revenue Generated, Products Performance, etc) for their different region. Data privacy requires that the various managers only see reports for their regions. A simple way to think about this is by creating different reports for the managers making a total of 3 Reports. 
 
I am sure you will agree with me that this isn't effective. more efforts and it is not scalable. what if it is a large multinational - country manager, regional manager, group manager, unit head, team leads all across the world? will you also build different reports for over 500 people? With Row Level Security, you can easily address this challenge by building a single Reports and set roles and rules to filter what everyone can see.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Power BI Dataset Storage Mode
 
A Power BI dataset can operate in one of the following modes to access data from a variety of data sources.

Import mode
DirectQuery mode
LiveConnect mode
Push mode

Detailed explanation can be found in the video session below.
 
Do You Always Need Refresh?
 
Based on the image below, you only need Data refresh if you are using the Import Storage Mode
 
 

 
Installing Personal Data Gateway
 
The on-premises data gateway acts as a bridge to provide quick and secure data transfer between on-premises data (data that isn't in the cloud) and several Microsoft cloud services. These cloud services include Power BI, PowerApps, Power Automate, Azure Analysis Services, and Azure Logic Apps. By using a gateway, organizations can keep databases and other data sources on their on-premises networks, yet securely use that on-premises data in cloud services.
 
 

 
 
Will Data Gateway Automatically Update My Reports?
Data Gateway will only make sure the dataset is accessible and through configured refresh, it can always remain updated. When you make changes to your Power BI report on the Desktop version, you will have to republish to update the online version.
 
Watch the Session 
In this live video session, you will be able to tie together all these topics with practical demonstration of these concepts.

Also: if you’re just reading this, today - the 28th of June - is the last day to submit to SpringOne 2022, being held in my hometown of San Francisco, California, in December of this year!

Armchair Architects, Uli Homann and Eric Charran, joined David Blank-Edelman for a lively discussion of Chaos Engineering from an architect’s point-of-view on the Azure Enablement Show. Read below for highlights and watch the video.
 
 
How do architects define and think about Chaos Engineering? 
Chaos engineering is that part of application development in which you try to excise uncertainty about specific failure conditions that might happen with the system or its components. Many architects just guess what's going to happen if there's a failure condition, and in many instances, they don't even like to think about it.

Hi, I am Aditya Oberai, a graduating Gold Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador, Computer Science and Engineering graduate from Amity University Uttar Pradesh in India, and a Developer Advocate at Appwrite. I've spent the last 3 years contributing to and supporting tech communities and hackathons in India and beyond, and I am really grateful to be able to help people use tech to help themselves every single day.
 

Problem Statement
 
I spent a major part of my student career organizing, participating, and mentoring at hackathons. One of the most common issues in the hackathon world that organizers come across is having a simple way to accept and manage project submissions from their participants.  Hackathon platforms are becoming more and more expensive to avail (plus they req…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do I Need DAX?
Let's start from this question, do you need Data Analysis Expression while learning Data Analysis using Microsoft Power BI? by the time you are done with this learning content, you will agree with me that you do not just need DAX, it is one of the concepts to separate beginners from Intermediates.
 
It Doesn't End with Drag and Drop
On several occasions, you've been able to build a Power BI Report by dragging and dropping the various fields involved from your connected tables. This is not always sufficient for all business questions, in many scenarios, you will need to apply DAX to create new measures and columns that will help you provide the right answers to the business question. Simply put it this way, DAX makes it possible to extend the functions of Microsoft Power BI.
 
Let's Dive In
I will save you all the definitions and explanations as this video is not only interactive, it simplifies the concept in an easy to understand way.

Azure Functions are great for running tasks on demand, like processing queue messages or resizing images. They can run serverless, which means that you can run them without having to configure and maintain infrastructure. And with Azure DevOps Pipelines, Microsofts' Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) solution, you can easily compile your Azure Functions and deploy to the Azure.

Overview
 
Azure Functions is a Serverless component from Microsoft that allows you to create event-based functions that can be dynamically scaled to meet the demand. We can work with all kinds of events such as when a file is uploaded to storage, a message appears in the queue or a HTTP request is received.
 
Using GitHub we can take an existing application, fork it to our account and then create our own version of the application, all from within VS Code.
 
What's covered in this lab
 
In this lab, you will:

Fork an existing Azure Functions project on GitHub
Learn how to create and merge branches in VS Code
Debug Functions with VS Code

Managed features for containerized applications
 
Using containers is a great way to make sure that your application can run anywhere and that it runs in the same environment, anywhere. In Azure, you can run containers in many services, including in Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Container Instances, Azure Service Fabric and more. And you can also run containers in Azure App Service. Running containers in Azure App Service enables you to use features like deployment slots and easy authentication and authorization.
 
In this post, we'll take a look at using deployment slots for containers in Azure App Service.

Azure is a very inclusive cloud platform. You can run applications on it that have been created in almost any programming language. This includes Java. And Microsoft has even created an Azure Toolkit for Eclipse to make it easier to use Azure when you are developing Java applications. Let's see how that works. In this post, we'll create a simple Java application and run that in an Azure App Service Web App.
 
Getting your development environment ready
 
Before we get started, we need to make sure that we can develop Java applications on our development machine and that we have the Azure toolkit for Eclipse installed. Follow the steps below to get your development environment ready.

Remove passwords committed to GitHub on accident
 
Writing code day after day means secrets, connection strings and more get added to your code accidentally. And if you are like me, they get committed to your GitHub repo and then you have to live in shame. =) In this post, I'll walk you through removing secrets from a GitHub repo that you've already committed the secret to.
 
Part 1 - Initial setup:
 
Scenario: You have committed a password with the value of qph@}uC,7cGLBdsX to your GitHub repo. This password should be confidential and not stored in the code.
 
How do you fix it?
 

Ensure you have the repo on your local disk or clone a fresh copy with HTTPS or SSH. I'll use SSH git clone git@github.com:mbcrump/crumpbot.git as a sample.

Easy file management
 
Azure Storage is a versatile and secure storage service. You can create storage containers with folder hierarchies and store Blobs in them. But it isn't very straightforward to move Blobs between containers or between storage accounts. Azure offers several options to help with this, including Azure Storage Explorer.
 
In this post, we'll use Azure Storage Explorer to move Blobs between containers in Azure Storage Accounts.

A simple way to run containers in Azure
 
Containers offer a great way to develop and run applications in a consistent environment. You can develop your app in a container on your local development machine, and run that same container in production, thereby eliminating differences in infrastructure between environments. And now, you can easily run containers in Azure with Azure Container Apps. Azure Container Apps abstracts the overhead of infrastructure and orchestration, making it easy for you to deploy and run a container.
In this post, we'll deploy a sample container to Azure Container Apps.

Application performance testing
 
When you build an application, you want it to be fast. Users should perceive it as fast and performant, even when many users are using it. And your application should continue to work without errors when it is under load. It can be difficult to know how your application behaves when it is used by many concurrent users. Azure Load Testing can help by putting your application under load and analyzing how it performs.
In this post, we'll test the performance of an existing web application with Azure Load Testing.

When we were curating the Data Analysis curriculum, we asked ourselves what most people spent months struggling to learn in data analysis using Power BI, then decide to bring experts and industry leaders that can break down these concepts in an hour. That’s massive transformation.
We all started Data Modelling from Nursey School --- Ahmed Oyelowo (MVP, MCT. AFM). I really don’t have anything to add to this rather than being so surprised that it is actually true. This just made it clear that the topic of Data Modelling in Power BI was demystified as if the audience are Nursery school students and every illustrations, examples, scenarios cited were great, relevant, and relatable.
 
I wouldn’t be breaking down this session for you, you need to watch this for yourself. The comments were great and you will agree even from the very first minute into the event.

Automated deployments create better software
When you need to manually build and deploy your app, each time that you make a change, you will make mistakes, which result in bugs and downtime for users. Automating your build and deployment processes makes them less error-prone and allows you to deploy as often as you want. GitHub Actions can help to automate your builds and deployments and integrates with Azure App Service.
 
In this post, we'll automatically build and deploy code to an Azure App Service using GitHub Actions.

This number is twice as high when you include situational and temporary impairments. What does this mean in numbers? If you deployed an application to a user group of 1000, around 200 of them will have a permanent disability and another 200 who consider themselves to have a temporary or situational impairment. That is around 400 users who will rely on various features in your application to make their experience better.
 
At Microsoft, we're passionate about empowering every person regardless of their condition. Accessibilitech Hackathon is one way Microsoft is committing to empowering people with disabilities to create, consume, and share content in their preferred way. But as a developer, how can you make your applications more accessible especially when building with Microsoft's Power Platform? It's easier than you think!
 
In this session on Microsoft Reactor, join Kristine Kolodziejski (Principal Technical Consultant based in the UK) and Japhlet Nwamu (Cloud Advocate at Microsoft) as they would walk you through a few tricks that would

Allow your users to switch themes dynamically,
Allow your users change font size in your apps dynamically,
Make your apps multilingual in less than ONE MINUTE
Enable you integrate text-to-speech in your apps and build your own screen reader,
Guide you through the do's and don'ts of design,
Help you leverage built-in Windows tools to create more accessible design,
Save user preferences for next time they launch the app! 🤩

To make it even better, all of these can be achieved WITHOUT premium connectors! Interesting right?
 
Below are the details of the session:Event Link: https://www.meetup.com/microsoft-reactor-mea/events/286688825/Date: Tuesday 21st June 2022Time: 5:00PM GMT +1

I was in Germany this time last week. Now, I’m back in beautiful San Francisco. Today the weather will climb to a monumental 84 F! That’s very unusual, for any time of the year, here in San Francisco. Most places here in San Francisco don’t have air conditioning. Some have heating. I bought a brand new condo in 2014 and it didn’t have air conditioning. You just open the window. I am privileged enough that I have air conditioning today, of course. I mention all this to say that it’s hot here! I worry for the elderly! When it gets this hot, the YMCA and other organizations typically invite elderly people to come in and get some cool air and water. It’s dangerous. Some days it gets even hotter. Very rare, but it does happen. I hope you’re all doing well. Take care of yourselves and each other, my friends. 

And, speaking of being hot, let’s look at this week’s roundup of the latest-and-greatest that’s hot off the press!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this video lesson, I go through the steps needed to identify resource groups that need to be removed. You'll use a GitHub Action that logs into Azure and then queries Resource Groups.
 
Resource Groups are groups of Azure services. If you follow a naming schema, you can then query Resource Groups that can be removed at the end of the day. In this video I use the word "demo" in a resource group, and then query all resource groups that have that word in it.
 
With that strategy, you can have flexibility by naming your resource groups while making sure they get deleted at the end of the day (or any other schedule you prefer).
 
Learning objectives:

Create a GitHub Action workflow to query Resource Groups  
Query Resource Groups that match locally 
Use scripting to extract Resource Group names 
Remove Resource Groups with the Azure CLI in GitHub Actions

 



 
Useful resources:

Since the launch of guest configuration in 2018, the product has been a key piece of many Azure security and Azure governance scenarios. The service enables customers to audit and report on configuration settings inside machines, at cloud scale. This past year, we have been working to support customers more holistically, shipping the public preview of  “Apply and Monitor” and “Apply and Autocorrect” assignment types, and are working hard on the upcoming GA of these capabilities.
 
We have been listening to our customers as well as the community and are excited to announce a name that highlights the current and future capabilities of our service. Guest configuration will become machine configuration. In addition to the name change, we are moving under the Automanage brand umbrella to reinforce the message that the goal of machine configuration is to reduce op-ex and customer burden in managing their Windows and Linux machines both in Azure and on-premises. It is important to note that the current experience within policy will not change. Customers will still be able to apply machine configurations at scale through policy assignments as they have thus far.

I am here today to do just one thing - to convince you that Microsoft Power BI is a super tool and can give you the superman effect :).
Part of the beauty of Microsoft Power BI is that you can actually generate dashboards and reports at the click of buttons. Don't also forget that spending 90% of your time creating beautiful visuals has less to do with value. It is the quality of time and thought you can give to your analysis and the insight generated that matter most because this is ultimately how value is been perceived by the business.
 
So, the more time you can save during your analysis, the more time you have to ask the critical questions of "What", and "Why". While not all dashboards and reports can be created at the click of buttons in Power BI, kno…]]></summary>

Authenticating is made easy by direct Action support in a workflow, but it requires a Service Principal created in a specific way that produces output that is required to go into a GitHub Secret.Using a sample GitHub repository, the video lesson will cover all the details you need to know to get a working GitHub workflow step to authenticate to Azure and then use the Azure CLI to perform operations.
 
The step in the workflow needs to include a secret from the Service Principal:

When the built-in user flows don't cut it you have to create custom policies based on XML, but it has been a somewhat bumpy ride getting the custom policies you craft uploaded to Azure. In the beginning you could only do it through the Azure Portal which made for a manual and error-prone deployment process. After a couple of interim improvements along the way we have eventually gotten to where it's possible to have an Azure DevOps based pipeline setup  invoking REST APIs to get the policies into the right place. It's not perfect though so I thought I'd take a crack at improving further upon this.

By enabling dynamic concurrency, the platform can adjust the concurrency of functions dynamically in the condition that the worker instance is healthy(like CPU and thread utilization is healthy). You can refer to more information about dynamic concurrency in this link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-concurrency#dynamic-concurrency.
 
In this blog, I am writing to introduce how DC works in Azure function apps with some tests.
 
How to enable Dynamic Concurrency?
By default, dynamic concurrency is disabled. With dynamic concurrency enabled, concurrency starts at 1 for each function, and is adjusted up to an optimal value, which is determined by the host.

I’ve just arrived in beautiful Berlin, Germany, for the forthcoming We Are Developers show with more than five thousand attendees. I was in Toronto, Canada, for the epic SpringOne Tour installment there. I’ve also had the privilege of taking these last two trips with my daughter, Kimly. She’s on summer break from school. It’s made the long miserable hours in economy bearable, and something for which I couldn’t be more grateful. I’m also looking forward to being at the upcoming SpringOne Tour installment in New York City, later this month. Don’t miss it! 

In the meantime, we’ve got a ton of good stuff to get to this week so let’s dive right in!

It's been a long and engaging week. helping you to get set for the learning journey ahead. Today, we discussed Azure Cloud Setup for Students. Let's start with this thought, how can you demonstrate the knowledge of the cloud without building on the cloud? How can you build on the cloud without funds to afford the cloud resources? Putting these into consideration, the chances for students to demonstrate knowledge of the cloud is low since they can't afford the cost of running cloud services. 
 

 
 
This is where Microsoft Azure for Student Account and benefit comes in. With it, students can have access to 25+ FREE Azure Services and $100 Azure credit. with this, they can acquire the cloud skill and experience needed to build their career in the cloud space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
The beauty of cloud computing is “Everything as Code”, and we can get rid of the physical constraint to create and manage IT infrastructure as code (IasC). At this moment, there are many IasC tools for Azure. Most of them are in descriptive style and like HTML which is a template and rendering engine creates the elements or resources.
This direction facilitates non-programmer users to pick up the tools easily. Users are hard to adopt software engineering technique to build a high quality IasC software. For experience programmers, they feel low level template code is leak of function and hard to maintain.
This post will show you the way to create Azure Infrastructure in TypeScript with Object Oriented programming style.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Go was created in 2009 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson. It's hard to estimate the number of Go developers but it's somewhere between 1.1 and 2.7 million, quite a sizeable amount. More than 2500 companies are using Go including, Google, Pinterest and Uber. So, you see, used by a lot of folks by big companies.
 
Why was Go created
As is often the case, a programming language is created to deal with the shortcomings of other languages. In this case, the creators wanted this new language to have the following capabilities:
 

Static typing and run-time efficiency from C.
Readability from JavaScript and Python.
High-performance networking and multi-processing

What is it used for though?
Here's some areas where you are likely to find a Go being used:

Cloud based and server-side apps
DevOp, automation
Command line tools
AI and data science

References
There's many great resources out there for learning the Go programming language like:

A Go program:
 
 
 
 
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
 fmt.Println("hello")
}
 
 
 
 
look at the readability of the program. The easiness of Python with a speed close to C++.

This blog post introduces a project I and my teammates developed as part of UBC's CPSC 416: Distributed Systems course. Our project BAG:EL is a distributed graph processor tool based on the Pregel API, and it supports node churn when running distributed graph queries.
 
Background
Distributed graph processing involves representing and interacting with large graphs across multiple machines. The Pregel-based approach for graph processing is a vertex-based implementation of the Bulk Synchronous Parallel model. A great explanation of Pregel's approach can be found here. In summary, the Pregel approach defines the notion of a set of supersteps …]]></summary>
