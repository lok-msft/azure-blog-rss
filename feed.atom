        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article details about a Lift and shift migration scenario which was tested successfully using Azure Migrate and is considered unique for two reasons.
 

The Virtual Machines were running Kubernetes workloads and all kinds of databases like Postgres, MySQL, Mongo DB etc.
IP retention was a prime requirement for the customer as they had certificates binded with the Load Balancer IP.

 
Customer had ~700+ Virtual machines running Kubernetes workloads from two environments (Dev and QA) and we migrated each environment in just a day and ensured that all the servers had their IP retained and their Kubernetes workloads started working exactly the same manner as how it used to work from on-premise. Planning of the migration (including replication time) etc went for 3 weeks and we migrated each environment over a weekend that included functional testing as well.  
 
Ofcourse, there was option to modernize the application by moving the workloads to AKS, but due to a strict migration timelines and customers inexperience in handling AKS we decided against it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the last few years, we’ve received extensive feedback around the need for a better custom logs experience in Azure Monitor Logs. To address it, the team stepped back, analyzed needs in the space, and rebuilt from the ground-up the full custom logs feature set. The features have been in preview for several months now, being vetted by many Log Analytics customers including some of the largest retailers, banks, and healthcare providers in the world. With preview feedback addressed and services now fully scaled out to meet the complex needs of these users and more, we are today excited to announce the revamped custom logs features are now generally available!
 
Today, we are announcing the following:

GA of the Log Ingestion API. This secure, scalable, and flexible API is the path going forward for all custom data ingestion needs.
GA of the Ingestion-time Transformations feature. This feature allows users to customize built-in data streams to parse, enrich, filter, or otherwise tailor incoming data to their specific use-cases.
A pricing for data sent to the system and subsequently dropped in a transformation. A nominal fee per GB dropped will be charged for any data dropped beyond 50% of incoming data, calculated daily. The fee is waived for Azure Sentinel-enabled workspaces. While we're announcing billing today, we will not start charging yet as of this announcement, and will provide at least a 3-month notice before doing so. The Azure Monitor pricing page will be imminently updated with these details.

For those of you who participated in our preview - thank you for your feedback, and to those new to the features - we're excited for you to start using them! To learn more, please start with our docs, and don’t hesitate to reach out should you have any questions!]]></summary>

I put together a Spring Tipds video introducing some of the major themes of Spring Framework 6 / Spring Boot 3. 


I also did an in-depth look at the new GraalVM support powered by Spring’s ahead-of-time (AOT) engine.

A global enterprise wants to migrate thousands of virtual machines (VMs) to Microsoft Azure as part of their application modernization strategy. Their first step is to exit their on-premises data centers and rapidly relocate their legacy application VMs to the Azure VMware Solution as a staging area for the first phase of their modernization strategy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure cloud service extended support(CSES) is a new Azure Resource Manager based deployment model for Azure Cloud Services product. Cloud Services (extended support) has the primary benefit of providing regional resiliency along with feature parity with Azure Cloud Services deployed using Azure Service Manager. It also offers some ARM capabilities such as role-based access and control (RBAC), tags, policy, and supports deployment templates. 
 
For the classic cloud service, we have Azure DevOps built-in pipeline task Azure Cloud Service Deployment task - Azure Pipelines | Microsoft Learn to help us manage the CI/CD progress easily and the task for CSES is not ready yet. In this blog, I have a brief guide on how to use the Azure ARM template to create or update the CSES deployment.

Spring Boot 3 is here (or will be tomorrow, on the 24th of November, 2022, to be more precise!), bringing a fantastic new Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation engine that supports GraalVM native images. Join me, and we’ll dive deep into the engine and its interactions with the Spring component model. 

This video is a detailed masterclass on the new AOT engine. It starts by examining the everyday usecases of an application developer and delves deeper and deeper into the engine, treating concerns that library and framework developers will care about. 

Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A picture showing .NET
What is .NET MAUI?
.NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) is a cross-platform framework for creating native mobile and desktop apps with C# and XAML. Using .NET MAUI, you can develop apps that can run on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows from a single shared code-base.
Using .NET MAUI, you can create multi-platform apps using a single project, but you can add platform-specific source code and resources if necessary. One of the key aims of .NET MAUI is to enable you to implement as much of your app logic and UI layout as possible in a single code-base.
 
In this blog, we will cover how to Build a Water Consumption Mobile App using .NET MAUI that consumes historical data from a Web API. This solution is part of a project build for .NET Conf Student Zone 2022
 
What will we be doing?
Before you can get started, we need a few things set up first:

Build a Mininal API from scratch to consume in your app
Build your first .NET MAUI App
Add a Consumption.cs class with the following propertiesA picture showing the Consumption.cs class
Add a APIManager.cs class to house the HTTP methods for your APIA picture showing the APIManager.cs class

After the above are added, you can start to:

Consume A Web API – this will show how you to consume the historical data stored in the Web API and display on your mobile app.
Send data to your Web API using the HTTP Post Method (shown in the link above too).

 
We have a dedicated Microsoft learn module that will show you how to Consume and Send Data to your Web API. All of the code for this part of the project and other parts are available on the .NET Student Zone Githup Repositry
 
To see and understand the how to implement this in Visual Studio you can watch my session below.

Finally, if you are curious about where the API data comes from, you can explore the other sessions of the .Net Student Conf and understand how all the different pieces and different technologies of .NET ecosystem are combined together into a single e-2-e project.]]></summary>

We walked through how to set up, run and analyze user loads with Azure Load Testing in part one of this series. In part two we will test different load patterns to show you how simulate them in Apache JMeter. A load pattern specifies how the simulated user load is adjusted during a load test.
While you might run smoke tests regularly with minimal load to avoid regressions, big events present scenarios to consider different types of load testing.
In this article we’ll discuss step loads, spike tests, breakpoint testing and soak testing patterns. Let’s get to it!

This article describes how to get container level stats in Azure Blob Storage, and how to work with the information provided by blob inventory.
 
The approach presented here uses Azure Databricks and is most suited to be used in storage accounts with a huge amount of data.
 
At the end of this article, you would be able to create a script to calculate:

The total number of blobs in the container 
The total container capacity (in bytes)
The total number of snapshots in the container
The total container snapshots capacity (in bytes)
The total number of versions in the container
The total container versions capacity (in bytes)
The total number of blobs in the container by BlobType
The total number of blobs in the container by Content-Type

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GitHub is known as the most common DevOps platform to share ideas and collaborate on innovative solutions, but also deploy applications on the Cloud via tools like Visual Studio Code and build easy-to-navigate projects portfolios. In short terms, GitHub is known as the developer's best friend. 
As software and technologies continue to evolve, also Github platform and services are constantly evolving. In this blog post, I wish to show you how the latest Git tools, GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Copilot, can transform and support the world of education.
 
In the following video, you'll be listening about two stories, whose scenarios will be familiar to anyone who is studying or teaching at University, or simply anyone who ever learned a new programming language/framework or prepared a hands-on workshop to deliver. 
The first story's character is Ali, a Data Science teacher at the University of Nowhere. She is preparing for her spring semester course and in particular, she’s preparing a guided tutorial, with a full list of all the instructions her students will need to set up the environment for her Python lab.
The second story is about Mark. Mark is a student at University of Nowhere. He attended the Python data science lab by prof Ali and now he needs to complete the assignment at home. However, he gets stuck at some point.
 
How Github Codespaces and Github Copilot will help them and make their tasks easier? Watch the video below to find out the answer.

You will also know that in some cases the best thing to do is to restore your workload from an existing backup to meet your Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) requirements.  Many organizations have implemented processes to regularly create backups of their workloads, but - in a majority of the cases - we only see the recovery plan that is associated with these backups in action, when problems occur.  
 
In many cases it’s not the lack of an existing backup that complicates things, but rather an insufficient or untested recovery plan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This blog is the complement of another blog which is related to Azure Event Hub Schema Registry. As we known, it’s not supported to migrate Confluent(Kafka) schema registry into Azure schema registry directly. We need to create and manage the scheme registry in the azure event hub separately. The good news is Azure Event Hub supplies multiple client sdks for us to use to serialize and deserialize payloads containing schema registry identifiers and avro-encoded data. In this section, I’d like to share how to use python sdk to send or receive events with schema registry in the Azure Event Hub mostly.  
 
Prerequisites:
1.Create a schema registry group in the event hub portal.
You could refer to this official guidance to create schema registry group.
 
2.Install required python packages with …]]></summary>

Many ISVs (Independent Software Vendors) are exchanging information with devices, applications, services, or humans. In many cases the information passed can be a file or a blob. Each of these ISVs would need to implement such a service. In the past few months, I discussed this capability with several (over 4) different customers, each with slightly unique needs. When I tried to generalize the need, it was clear: they wanted a quick, safe means to exchange files with customers or devices. 
 
So, I tried to translate these asks into user stories: 
 
As a service provider, I need my customers to upload content in a secure, easy-to-maintain micro-service exposed as an API (application programming interfaces) so that I can process the content uploaded and perform an action on it.

I really liked Python as a teaching language and as a first language for many students, due to its relatively low usage of punctuation and its tendency to read like an English sentence.
However, as it is a text-based language, there are still many frustrating ways to mess up a Python program – spelling things wrong, indenting incorrectly, not using the right function for the job, etc. – and new programmers can have a particularly hard time understanding how to fix incorrect code. Teachers and TAs can help students decipher errors, but we’re not always around when they’re coding, especially in large classes (my class size ranged from 1000-2000!).

Many enterprises use a schema registry for schema evolution use cases, such as the Confluent Schema Registry. Starting with version 1.1.x of Spring Cloud Stream until 3.0.0, we provided a schema registry server and AVRO-based schema registry client converters that can reconcile the schema from the schema registry server. Spring Cloud Stream version 3.0.0 moved the Schema Registry components into a top-level spring-cloud project, and Spring Cloud Stream included those in its BOM for the end user applications to consume them. However, this didn’t scale well, and with the 3.2 version, we decided to stop having them as part of the Spring Cloud Stream BOM.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Test driven development (TDD)
Test driven development, or TDD, is a method of directly coupling testing with every part of your daily development. Developers who use TDD typically start developing by first writing a test that fails, and then writing the code that makes the test pass. This approach means that product code is more likely to get high test coverage, and the tests typically come first.
 
Many developers find this pattern useful to help them prioritize good architecture from the start of development, and to stay laser-focused on each part of the functionality they need to implement. This school of thought advocates for testing not being an after-thought of development, but rather a driving force.
 
For example, in the following image, you can see that AddTest is written and fail…]]></summary>

I’ve been visiting with customers and talking to the community here in South East Asia. I was in Malaysia last week, and now I’m in Bangkok, Thailand. I’m near the end of my time here in SE Asia, which makes me sad. I’m dearly going to miss the food and the weather, but time waits for no person, and it’s almost time to go home.

And with time comes a jam-packed roster of new things we can read and learn from. So, without further ado, let’s dive right into it!

Spring Modulith 0.1 M2 released

  
Have you tested your application against the upcoming Spring Boot 3? There’s a ton of amazing new features arriving in this release and you should definitely be kicking the tires now. Remember: Spring Framework 6 is due in about a week’s time and Spring Boot 3 is due less than a few weeks after that! And you know where to go: start.spring.io]]></summary>

Both are best practice guidance around how to transform your organization to be cloud-centric (CAF) and how to build and manage cloud-hosted applications securely, cost-effectively, etc. (WAF).
 
But why are they important, and why should you, and your organization, use them on your cloud transformation journey?
 
Based on my experience of 30+ years in IT, including 10 years as CTO of DevOpsGroup (An Amdocs company) and 5yrs as a Microsoft Regional Director, I’ll give you 3 reasons:

To simplify application deployment on Kubernetes, we’re building an experience that brings together a set of tools and AKS add-ons to help you get from source code to running on an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using familiar tools and environments like Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and the Azure portal.

If you think about it, if you start from a source code of an application, say a microservice, that you want to run on Kubernetes, there are a number of steps and prerequisites:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Move app service resources across subscriptions
Many customers try to migrate across subscriptions, resource groups, and so on. Sometimes they use uploaded certificates in the App service instead of ASC.This blog will be helpful when they migrate App service resources with uploaded certificates. I wrote this blog for testing based on Azure docs.
 
See move across subscriptions 

 
Testing Steps
1. Prerequisites
2. Upload and bind certificates to App Service
3. Do the migration
4. Validate the result
 
1. Prerequisites
- App Service- App service domain: in my case, tlsmigrationtest.com- Add a custom domain to App Service: SSL isn't bound yet

 
2. Upload and bind certificates
Upload certificate (.pfx) and bind certificate to the app service domain.
A. App service > TLS/SSL settings > Private Key Certificates (.pfx) > Upload Certificate

 
B. Upload the certificate

C. Bind certificates
App Service > Custom domains > Add bindings

 
After finishing the above steps, you can see the SSL binding to the App Service domain.

 
3. Migration across subscriptions with uploaded certificates
A. For migration, go to your resource group.
 
B. Before moving resources you must click "show hidden types"
When you check "show hidden types", you can see uploaded certificates.

 
C. Check all App service resources and click move to another subscription
You must move all App Service resources together such as App Service, App service domain, and certificates.
Check limitation Move Azure App Service resources across resource groups or subscriptions - Azure Resource Manager | Microsoft Learn

 
D. Validate the result
Before you migrate app service resources, you can see the validation status.
If you can see succeeded status like below, you will be able to migrate successfully.

 
4. Success migration
Uploaded app service certificates are still bound to the App Service domain in the new subscription.]]></summary>

So you're building serverless applications with Microsoft Azure Functions, but you need to persist data to a database. What do you do about controlling the number of concurrent connections to your database from the function? What happens if the function currently connected to your database shuts down or a new instance comes online to scale with demand?
 
The concept of serverless in general, whether that be through a function or database, is great because it is designed for the modern application. Applications that scale on-demand reduce the maintenance overhead and applications that are pay as you go reduce unnecessary costs.

Black Friday, Small Business Saturday and Cyber Monday will test your app’s limits, and so it’s time for the technical teams to ensure that the digital platforms deliver when it is needed the most.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many work apps need the ability to schedule a meeting with others in their organization. Here's how to do it for apps connected to Microsoft 365.
 
Work apps need work data
Work apps serve a specific purpose: they help you track projects, follow orders or manage resources. But rarely do they contain all the information that users need to complete their work. Typically, information about people, their calendars, or communication is stored elsewhere, like in Microsoft 365. And that's a shame because completing a task requires users to switch between different apps, which is detrimental to their productivity. Unless of course, you bring work data into your work app.
 
Find a meeting time and schedule a meeting on Microsoft 365
A common scenario for work apps is to schedule a meeting with others in the organization. While it sounds trivial, the app must be able to access attendees' calendars, find a suitable meeting time and schedule the meeting. And that's where Microsoft Graph comes in.
 
Recently I published an article on freeCodeCamp that shows you how to build an app connected to Microsoft 365 that can find a meeting time and schedule a meeting.
 

 
The app shows you how to make the best use of features available in the Microsoft Graph Toolkit and Microsoft Graph to build a UI that you could integrate with another app.
 
Want to learn more joing our 30 days of Graph challenge runs from November 1-30, 2022. Watch  this short YouTube video to find out why you should participate! 
 
Register for the 30 Days of Microsoft Graph Challenge today.
 
Check it out, and I'm looking forward to hearing what you think!]]></summary>

This is the beginning of a larger series so not all the features you see on the app are complete. We will walk this journey together as we add more production level of deployment into the repo. (Aka. Key-Vault for secrets, Managed Identity and Infrastructure As Code. :))

Impact



Users who have applied the mitigation should take note of the following impact:



No authorized scopes are mapped to the principal (current user) when the Authorization Server (AS) responds to the OAuth2 Access Token Response with an empty or missing scope parameter.



If you are affected by this vulnerability, users will not be granted any authorities beginning with SCOPE_ when the AS does not return scopes. Only the special authority ROLE_USER is given to the principal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure App Service on Linux images using PHP 8.x are now bundled with NGINX instead of Apache. The use of .htaccess files will not work for NGINX as these are used for Apache only. This will require the need to setup a custom startup script and modifying the existing NGINX site configuration.
 

 
Navigate to your App Service via the Azure Portal. Under the Development Tools section, select SSH then Go -->.
Modifying the default site config
You will want to make a copy of the existing configuration and place the file inside the /home/site directory.
 


cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /home/site/default


Once you created a default page as in the previous step, please update the location block to add HSTS Header and create the custom startup script as mentioned below
  
location / {           
index  index.php index.html index.htm hostingstart.html;
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
}
Creating the custom startup script
You will now need to create a custom startup script and save the file as /home/site/startup.sh



#!/bin/bash

cp /home/site/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
service nginx reload


In the custom startup script, we are doing the following:

Overriding the existing /etc/nginx/sites-available/default file with the /home/site/default file.
Reloading the NGINX service to make the updates take effect.

Updating the application settings
Navigate back to your App Service via the Azure Portal. Under the Settings section, select Configuration.
Go over to the General Settings section of the Configuration blade.
For the Startup Command enter the following: /home/site/startup.sh
Save these settings and navigate to your application https://{sitename}.azurewebsites.net/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spring Session 3.1.0-RC1 has been released. The biggest news from this release is that Spring Session Geode was removed which means all of the Spring Modules now belong to the same lifecycle. This means that the Spring Session BOM no longer uses CalVer and instead uses the same version as the remaining Spring Session modules. For example, in this release the version of spring-session-bom is 3.0.0-RC1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today we are announcing the availability of 220+ SAP S/4HANA events on Azure. A homologous announcement from SAP is found here.
 
Many companies rely on SAP S/4HANA and an assortment of custom applications, SaaS services, or other commercial solutions to run their business functions. Given this diverse deployment topology, they require their SAP S/4HANA applications to work together with other applications that run on Azure.  A way to achieve this is by integrating both systems using an event-driven approach. You can now configure your SAP Event Mesh (SAP’s event broker) to send SAP events to Azure Event Grid more easily than current alternative approaches. This way, your applications on Azure can react to system state changes that originate in an SAP backend application. This approach avo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure Backup recently launched the public preview of immutable vaults that can help you protect your backup data better against ransomware attacks and other malicious actors. Immutable vaults protect your backups by blocking any operations that could lead to loss of recovery points if misused. Further, you can lock the immutability setting to make it irreversible, which can prevent malicious actors from disabling immutability and deleting backups.
Immutability is supported for Recovery Services vaults as well as Backup vaults.
How it works
Backup data stored using Azure Backup is not accessible directly and the only way to access or manage this data is through the vault. Immutable vaults help you by preventing any operations that, if used by malicious actors, could lead to the loss of back…]]></summary>

Show upcoming meetings for a Microsoft 365 user
Recently, I published an article on freeCodeCamp that shows you how you can build in just 10 minutes a simple personal assistant that shows upcoming meetings for the signed-in user.

 

 
Showing upcoming meetings is a common scenario when integrating Microsoft 365 in work applications. It shows you how to get information from the user's calendar and check their availability for a particular time slot. And it's also a great way to get started with building apps on Microsoft 365.
 
The tutorial shows you the basics of setting up auth in a single-page app and using the Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK to connect to the Microsoft Graph API. It also demonstrates working with calendar views and formatting dates.This is just one of many scenarios and types of apps that you can implement on Microsoft 365. For more information about the type of data and insights stored on Microsoft 365 that you can tap into, check out the Microsoft Graph API documentation.

I’m in sunny Singapore, then off to Malaysia and Thailand. It’s the first time I’ve been to any of these places since 2019! How good it is to be back! I’ve so missed it.

The Spring team is busy preparing for both Spring Boot 3 (and the Spring Framework 6 release that underpins it) and SpringOne 2022. Have you booked your ticket for SpringOne 2022 yet? It’s going to be held in sunny San Francisco, and - of course - it’ll be the absolute best place to learn about Spring Framework 6, Spring Boot 3, GraalVM, the new Ahead-of-time compilation engine in Spring Boot 3, and more. Also, it’s a rare chance to hang out with the Spring team proper.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a function app, usually we use appsetting AzureWebJobsStorage to connect to storage. This blog shows you how to configure a function app using Azure Active Directory identities instead of secrets or connection strings, where possible. Using identities helps you avoid accidentally leaking sensitive secrets and can provide better visibility into how data is accessed.
 
This will not work if the storage account is in a sovereign cloud or has a custom DNS.
 
Below are the steps to do configuration.
 
1. Enable system assigned identity in your function app and save it.

 
2. Give storage access to your function app. Search for Storage Blob Data Owner, select it.

 
 

 

 
 
 
3. If you configure a blob-triggered function app, repeat the step 2 to add Storage Account Contributor and Storage Queue Data Contributor roles which will be used for blob trigger.

 

 
 
4. Return to Access Control (IAM), click Role assignments, search for your function app name to confirm the roles are added successfully.

 
 
5. Navigate to your function app. Select Configuration and edit AzureWebJobsStorage. Change the name to AzureWebJobsStorage__accountname.  Change the value to your storage account name. (The new setting uses a double underscore (__), which is a special character in application settings.) 

 
 
6. Delete the previous AzureWebJobsStorage. Then you will find your function app still works fine.]]></summary>

Microservice-based systems have become ubiquitous in the last couple of years. However, the idea of monolithic, modular systems has also regained popularity recently.
Independent of the architectural style ultimately selected, the individual applications comprising the overall system need their structure to be evolvable and able to follow changes in business requirements.



Traditionally, application frameworks have provided structural guidance by providing abstractions aligned with technical concepts, such as Spring Framework’s stereotype annotations (@Controller, @Service, @Repository, and so on).

We came across many uses cases wherein customers wished to do more with their JMeter scripts, like ability to manipulate variables, or to use logs to debug the conditions. It is almost possible to achieve many of the use cases through the commonly available JMeter elements and augment them with the rich source of plugins available. There may be instances wherein it would be required for the test authors to script in order to manipulate the data before or after it is passed to samplers.
 
This blog will highlight steps on how to retrieve a user id from a JSON response and then pass it to the next request to fetch the details of a user. The details would be displayed on the log. This is a very common use case wherein it would be required…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our ISV partners have been asking for a way to provide an easy way to package their Kubernetes based solutions into the Marketplace and we're excited to announce K8s Apps to meet their needs.
 
ISV's are excited about this because it allows them to transact their offers in the Azure Marketplace via CI/CD.  This includes 48 hour publishing turnaround, automated security vetting and a self-service experience.  Customers look forward to the easy deployment, automated patching and using these offers to decrement their MACC.
 
Since then, a lot of information has come out and our partners are looking for guidance on how to get started.  I've recorded this End-To-End video which walks through the steps of an ISV Creating and Publishing an Offer as well as a Customer Purchasing the offer.  This is a more detailed version of the demo seen at Ignite.
 



 
 
All of the code available for the Minecraft As A Service demo is on GitHub.
 
If you are an ISV and interested in getting started in the K8s Apps in the Marketplace, I recommend the following:
 

Read the blog for the Ignite Announcement
Watch the full demo video
Fill out the Public Preview Invite Form
Review the Mastering Container Offers on-demand course and workshop
Register for the Marketplace Summit

 
When you're ready to publish your offer to the marketplace, these docs will guide you:

Create the Offer
Prepare your Technical Assets
Create/Publish offer in Partner Center
Deploy the Offer

Come join some of our other partners that have already taken the leap!

Tetrate Istio Distro
Elastic Cloud

I hope this helps you on your journey into K8s Apps on the Azure Marketplace and we'll see your offer available for customers soon.]]></summary>

I did a presentation with my friend and hero James Ward on Spring and Kotlin (that was voted third most-liked talk at a show with more than 250 speakers!) That was a personal career highlight for me - it’s not often you get to win and have fun in life. And, as if that wasn’t awesome enough, this week I am in Las Vegas, NV, for JavaOne! Fingers crossed, this week will go smoothly, too! Both Devoxx and JavaOne are the first such shows since at least before the pandemic. It’s been a very long time in coming and I’m elated, overjoyed, to be able to be here.

And, of course, I’m super excited about SpringOne 2022! Also, the first in-person show of its kind since before the pandemic! It’s going to be amazing. Have you registered? If not, you might consider using this registration code - S1VM22_Advocate_200.

And this week’s busy roundup reflects the usual flurry of activity on the Spring team as we ready releases for our end-of-November timelines for Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, which means we’ve got a ton of stuff to get into this week, so let’s!

It’s Sunday the 16th of October as I write this and I’m winging my way to sunny Las Vegas, Nevada, where I’ll be attending (and presenting at) the first JavaOne show in years! It didn’t exist as the JavaOne we know and love for years, even before the pandemic interrupted life as we know it worldwide. So this isn’t just the first JavaOne since 2019, it’s [the first JavaOne since 2017](https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/04/oracle-kills-java-one/_! I can’t wait to be there, to see the amazing community, to soak up the sun and fun with my teammates and friends in the ecosystem. And we want to see you, too.

There are a few of us doing talks from the Spring team and we’d love to see you!

First of all: we have a booth, so join us there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, Spring fans! I was just at Devoxx in Belgium, where hundreds of experts from across the Java ecosystem converged for the first time since 2019 to deliver their biggest and best. 

I could do a proper trip report, but I really just came here to point you to two talks from two of my amazing teammates, Stéphane Nicoll (@snicoll) and Brian Clozel (@bclozel), who have been very hard at work on both Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, both of which will land by the end of November, 2022. These are brand new generations of the framework, implying huge new paradigms and new opportunities for developers. 

This first is a broader, whirlwind tour of the new features in Spring Framework 6 (which bubble up into Spring Boot 3).


This second one introduces the new ahead-of-time (AOT) support in Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, which makes it trivial to build GraalVM native images.



NB: please ignore the metadata for the YouTube videos. Both talks feature both speakers, and there is no mention whatsoever of React and JavaScript and the like. I think that was a metadata issue with the publication of the videos on YouTube, which will hopefully be resolved. 

Enjoy! 

If you missed this event, that’s OK - there’s still time to join the Spring team and larger Java ecosystem for SpringOne, being held 6-8 December, 2022, in sunny San Francisco, CA, 94105! Join us!

The easiest way to connect your app to Microsoft 365
Using Microsoft Graph Toolkit is the easiest way to connect your app to Microsoft 365. Toolkit's components help you retrieve relevant data from Microsoft 365 and show it in your app in any way you want. And with toolkit's authentication providers, setting up auth is a matter of adding a few lines of code. Never again fiddle with setting up a login, handling access tokens, building web requests, and dealing with errors.
 
Learn Microsoft Graph Toolkit interactively
To help you learn what Microsoft Graph Toolkit has to offer and how you'd use it in your app, we recently released a new learning path on Microsoft Learn. By following a few learn modules you'll learn everything that you need to know to use the toolkit in your app. But that's not all.
Thinking about the different ways in which people learn, we've launched an experiment - an interactive code tour that you can follow to add Microsoft Graph Toolkit to a React app.

 

 
By following the instructions in the tour, you gradually extend an empty React app with Microsoft Graph Toolkit turning it into a true Microsoft 365 app. What's cool about this code tour, is that it puts the code of your app in the center. Rather than reading long-form, you're in the code and get relevant, and in-place tips for building your app.
 
The Microsoft Graph Toolkit React code tour is a great way to quickly experience how you'd use the toolkit in a React app. We'd love it if you gave it a try and told us what you think. Shall we consider building tours for other technologies and scenarios?

What is observability? In our understanding, it is "how well you can understand the internals of your system by examining its outputs". We believe that the interconnection between metrics, logging, and distributed tracing gives you the ability to reason about the state of your system in order to debug exceptions and latency in your applications. You can watch more about what we think observability is in this episode of Enlightning with Jonatan Ivanov.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Communication between a client application and an Azure Service Bus namespace is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS is a standard cryptographic protocol that ensures privacy and data integrity between clients and services over the Internet. For more information about TLS, see Transport Layer Security.
 
Azure Service Bus supports choosing a specific TLS version for namespaces. Currently Azure Service Bus uses TLS 1.2 on public endpoints by default, but TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are still supported for backward compatibility.
 
Azure Service Bus namespaces permit clients to send and receive data with TLS 1.0 and above. To enforce stricter security measures, you can configure your Service Bus namespace to require that clients send and receive data with a newer version of TLS. If a Service Bus namespace requires a minimum version of TLS, then any requests made with an older version will fail. 
 
Thanks to your input and feedback, this feature is now in general availability.

We are excited to announce the availability of several new features and major enhancements in Azure Event Hubs, which will be available in October 2022.
 
Log Compaction – Public Preview
With log compaction feature, you can create compacted event hubs or compacted Kafka topics which retain events using key-based retention. By default, each event hub/Kafka topic is created with time-based retention, where events are purged upon the expiration of the retention time.

Most customers tell us they prefer to run a larger number of smaller clusters, but some very large workloads can be run much more efficiently on bigger clusters. To support this, we have increased the number of nodes you can have in a single Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster from 1,000 to 5,000.  This will allow you to reduce the number of clusters needed to run your workloads, reducing the operational overhead needed to support application teams.
 
When using the uptime SLA you can request a quota increase across all node pools in the cluster by raising a support request.

Modern applications run on complex environments using a plethora of cloud services, and it can take days—if not weeks—for developers to get access to the resources they need. On top of that, organizations lack centralized visibility into environments, making it hard to ensure they run securely and in compliance with corporate policies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Java Profiler for Azure Monitor Application Insights is now in Public Preview. It is a new capability in Azure Monitor to help Java developers troubleshoot performance issues and uncover performance bottlenecks. 
  
Under the hood, it uses Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to profile your application using a customized configuration.  For additional context, JFR is a tool that collects profiling data of running Java applications, and it is integrated into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). JFR comes with little to barely noticeable overhead cost which makes it great to run on heavily loaded production deployments. 
  
Using the customized configuration, you can generate profiles in two ways: 
  

Automated Profiling - Configure CPU and memory thresholds to automatically trigger a profile recording. 
On-demand Profiling - Use “Profile Now” to run near real-time profile recording. 

 To try out the Java Profiler:
 

Enable Azure Monitor Application Insights using v3.4.1 jar file or later. 
Enable the profiler using the java profiler installation guidance and set your CPU/Memory triggers for automatic profiling. 
Click the "Profiler" button on the Application Insights Performance Blade and click "Profile Now" for an on-demand profile. 
Download the profiling session when it becomes available (it may take about 5 minutes to show up in Portal). 
View and analyze the profile with Java Mission Control (JMC) or another tool (java profiles are not currently viewable in Portal). 

  

 
  
Java Profiling is in preview today and can be enabled across all your JVMs. Even better, it is included in Application Insights for no additional cost. Try it out and let us know what you think!]]></summary>

What wasn’t clear was how to set a desired communication protocol and maintain this at scale, until now.
 
To prevent bad actors from accessing or disrupting sensitive data as it moves through the internet, we have relied on various cryptographic protocols over the years, namely Secure Socket Layers (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS). As weaknesses were discovered, new versions of SSL and then TLS were created and although technologies have evolved, so have the tactics of hackers and other cyber criminals.
 
As of 2020, TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer supported. TLS 1.2 is required to maintain secure connections and …]]></summary>

Sometimes, we may encounter the following error when accessing wordpress website.
 

 
It is very easy to understand that there is something wrong with the connection between the website and database. But how can we find more detailed information regarding this error?
 
We can enable WordPress debugging mode to check the detailed error message. The steps are as below.
 
1.Login to the newui of the scm site.(https://{sitename}.scm.azurewebsites.net/newui)
2.Click File Manager and find the wp-config.php file under site/wwwroot folder.
 

  
3.Change "define( 'WP_DEBUG', false);" to "define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );" in wp-config.php file. We can edit it directly from the newui portal.
 
With this change, you can try to access the wordpress site again without restarting the app service. You will see the detailed error message when accessing the website.

 
You may see below possible error messages. I added some suggestions for each kind of error for your reference.

Azure Storage supports soft delete to protect your data for Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. Soft delete allows you to recover data that has been deleted within a retention period.

The documentation provides some Powershell examples to recover all soft-deleted objects. In some scenarios, you may want to undelete with Powershell scripts to undelete many blobs with certain conditions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're a web developer, there's an exciting opportunity for you to build applications for Microsoft 365, which many organizations across the world use for work. Let me show you, how you can use your existing skills and build your first application that integrates with Microsoft 365 in just 10 minutes.
 
What's Microsoft 365?
Microsoft 365 is a set of applications, like Microsoft Teams, Outlook, Word, or SharePoint, that organizations use for work. Every day, millions of people use Microsoft 365 to chat, meet, send emails, create documents, and more.
 
But Microsoft 365 isn't just a set of apps. It's also a platform that enables developers, like yourself, to build applications. These apps can tap into data and insights stored on Microsoft 365 and bring them into people's workflows.
 
Building for a platform
Building for a platform isn't trivial. It comes with all kinds of specific knowledge you have to have like what tooling, SDKs, and APIs to use, how to integrate your app, and finally how to package and distribute it. What many people forget though, is that you don't have to learn everything about everything at once. Often, you can start simple and build up from there.
 
Build your first Microsoft 365 app in just 10 minutes
Recently, I published an article on freeCodeCamp that shows you how you can build your first Microsoft 365 app in just 10 minutes.

 

 
Sure, the app is simple and doesn't do much, but when building it, you'll learn the fundamental concepts of building apps on Microsoft 365. And after these 10 minutes, you'll have a functional app that works and retrieves data from Microsoft 365, and which you can use as a starting point for more complex apps.
 
Give it a try, and we're looking forward to hearing what you think.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overview
In this How To, I will show a simple mechanism for reading items from CosmosDB using Azure API Management (APIM). Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed, serverless NoSQL database for high-performance applications of any size or scale. APIM is a API management service offering many features for manging APIs and exposing backend services.
 
Example Use Case
The example use case involves using CosmosDB to maintain a list of information and exposing the information using APIM as a public RSS feed. This will provide a user to illustrate APIM caching and transformation, and how APIM can call CosmosDB securely using managed identity.
 
Setup
The first step is to provision a CosmosDB and APIM service instance. In my resource group, I created the following services:

        <updated>2022-10-05T02:50:30.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scenario
Goal: Blob storage can access only from the app service.So, you want to set the blob storage firewall for inbound traffic.
 
Blob storage firewall limitation in this scenario
1. IP address
 IP network rules have no effect on requests originating from the same Azure region as the storage account.
 See Grant access from an internet IP range 
2. Service tag
 There isn't an App service tag.

 
ps. When clients request blob storage through app service, blob storage receives not App service IP but Client IP.
 
Workaround
1. Add IP address when app service and storage are located in a different region.
When resources are located in a different region, the IP address firewall setting works.
2. Firewall with Virtual Network
When blob storage uses VNet firewall, app service must be integrated with VNet.
If you want to read what is VNet integration, see VNet integration 

 
Before setting VNet integration, you must check limitations.
Integrate your app with an Azure virtual network - Azure App Service | Microsoft Learn
 
1. Set Vnet Integration on the app service
Add VNet to your app service.
I use "firwall-storage-vnet" VNet as below.
 

 
2. Blob storage firewall setting with VNet which is integrated with app service

3. If you use a function app, please add WEBSITE_CONTENTOVERVNET = 1
A value of 1 enables your function app to scale when you have your storage account restricted to a virtual network. 
You can see the detail about this setting website_contentovervnet]]></summary>

Nuxt 2 apps that have been upgraded with Nuxt Bridge also work with Azure Static Web Apps.
 
What’s new in Nuxt 3? 
 

Zero-configuration deployment of Nuxt 3 and Nuxt Bridge applications with universal rendering to Azure Static Web Apps 
API routes support for automatic generation from server API and middleware directories 
Vue 3 support including composition API with imported functions for better code re-usability 
Nitro Engine, a full stack server that allows deployment of output on Node.js, serverless, edge-side rendering, or as static 
Vite, a frontend tooling that features fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimizes assets for production 

Universal rendering vs static rendering
 
Previously, you were able to deploy a static rendered Nuxt app on Azure Static Web Apps, where the entire app is pre-generated as static content. However, Nuxt 3 also supports universal rendering, which provides the performance and search engine optimization of server-side rendering while still enabling client-side interactivity.
 
With Nuxt 3's support for Azure Static Web Apps, you can now deploy sites with universal rendering. 
 
To learn more, check out the Nuxt 3 site deployment with universal rendering on Azure Static Web Apps documentation that also includes a tutorial.

Adaptive sampling is enabled by default.
Fixed-rate sampling is not supported.
Ingestion sampling only applies when no other sampling is in effect. Therefore, this is also disabled by default in the wake of point #1 above.

 
 
If you expect data (invocations) under Monitor but do not find it as shown in screenshot below, you have either changed Host.Results category to Warning (or above) level; or your application telemetry is getting sampled. To fix the former, open Host.json file and change the Host.Results category to Information level.
 
{
  "logging": {
    "fileLoggingMode": "always",
    "logLevel": {
      "default": "Information",
      "Host.Results": "Information",
      "Function": "Error",
      "Host.Aggregator": "Trace"
    }
  }
}
 
 
If Host.Results category is already set at Information level, disable telemetry sampling as the next step.
 

 
 
 
To disable the sampling, set "isEnabled": false in host.json file as shown below -
 
{
  "logging": {
    "applicationInsights": {
      "samplingSettings": {
        "isEnabled": false
       }
    }
  }
}
 
After disabling sampling, you can confirm it by running a query similar to the following; RetainedPercentage should show 100%.
 

 
 
 
 
At this point, the function invocations should start appearing under Monitor on Azure Portal UI.]]></summary>

The purpose of this developer's quick start guide is to help you build cloud-native Java applications in Azure. You’ll gain insights about using NoSQL and why you should consider Azure Cosmos DB, our fully managed, distributed NoSQL database service on Azure. 
These insights are designed to be useful, starting with a NoSQL background or coming into a project with a relational mindset. Data isn’t the only thing involved in an application, and this guide will take you through working with other Azure services that integrate well with Azure Cosmos DB. 
You’ll learn how to host Java applications in Azure Spring Apps or set up notifications with Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps.

Node.js has two module systems:
1)  CommonJS modules and
2)  ECMAScript modules.
 
1) CommonJS: The de facto standard for modules in Node.js currently  is CommonJS. CommonJS modules are defined in normal .js files using module.exports or .cjs.
Modules can be used later within other .js files with the require() function.
Import using require (Common JS) :
 
 
// foo.js
module.exports = function() {
  return 'Hello foo!';
}

// index.js
var foo = require('./foo');
console.log(foo()); // Hello foo!
 
 
 
to run this example:
 
 
 
node index.js

Security Challenges with Passwords
 
Passwords should be used with caution, and developers must never place passwords in an unsecured location. Many Java applications connect to backend data, cache, messaging, and eventing services using usernames and passwords, or other sensitive credentials such as access tokens or connection strings. If exposed, the passwords could be used to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information such as a sales catalog that you built for an upcoming campaig…]]></summary>

Btw, the last section on the Terraform state file in Azure storage is documented here on Microsoft Docs, however I have captured the complete solution here.
 
Four easy steps:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[You can use client side decryption of properties on Azure Spring Apps by following the steps below:
Add the encrypted property in your .properties file in your git repository.It would look like:


message={cipher}f43e3df3862ab196a4b367624a7d9b581e1c543610da353fbdd2477d60fb282f


Update the Config Server on Azure Spring App to use the git repository which has our encrypted property. You could do it directly from Azure Portal or use Azure CLI:
az spring-cloud config-server git set -n myspringcloud --uri <git_repo_url>

In your Spring Boot application, add the decryption key in the bootstrap.yml file. (You would need to create it if it does not exist)


encrypt:
  key: somerandomkey



[This is the key you would have used in order to encrypt your property earlier]Now, add some code to get the value of the encrypted property.


package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class TestController {

    @Value("${message:default}") 
    String message;

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String hello() {
        return message;
    }

}



Create an App, or deploy to an existing one.
az spring-cloud app create -n <appName>

 
Deploy your app.
az spring-cloud app deploy -n appName --jar-path <location_of_jar>

 
Assign a public endpoint (or use the Test Endpoints)
az spring-cloud app update -n appName --assign-endpoint true

 
Access your application to view the value.
https://<myspringcloud>-<appName>.azuremicroservices.io/

 
(Optional) You can check the encrypted values on the Config Server by following the steps mentioned in thisdocumentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-cloud/how-to-access-data-plane-azure-ad-rbac]]></summary>

There are two ways in which you could run a shell script in WordPress on Azure App Service.

Web SSH – run shell commands and scripts that are non-persistent
The start-up File – run shell commands and scripts that need to be persistent

1. Using Web SSH
As we have mentioned earlier, web SSH can be used to run commands and scripts that are non-persistent. For example, navigating folders, reading the contents of a file, or echoing a message. Here, we will learn how to echo “Hello World!” in web SSH.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overview
In this How To, I will show a simple mechanism for writing a payload to Azure Blob Storage from Azure API Management (APIM). Some examples where this approach is useful:

Claim-CheckClaim-Check pattern is used to split a large message into a claim check and a payload. The claim check is sent to a downstream system which has a reference to the location of the payload. The downstream system then retrieves the payload for handling. You might want to do this when working with technology that are not optimised suited for very large messages (Service Bus) either by a size limitation or associated cost, or when you do not need to process all messages.

Key 5G characteristics such as very low latency, coverage of large and broad areas, high bandwidth, and very importantly as a differentiator versus Wi-Fi, QoS, reliability, security, slicing, and even network APIs to interact with the network from your apps make those new scenarios possible.
 
We’re excited to share this Infographic or “cheat sheet” we created explaining the key topics related to 5G, fundamental characteristics of 5G, new possible topologies (5G Private MEC and 5G Public MEC), and some details and elements of a simplified 5G architecture when using 5G with Azure Private MEC solution.

In a previous post, we introduced the isolated process model, which decouples your function code from the core Azure Functions host, in contrast to the traditional model where we run them together in the same process. Functions V4 supports .NET 6 in both models, and the isolated process model also supports .NET 7 (public preview) and Framework 4.8 (public preview). In this update, we’ll re-cap some of our recent updates, outline some changes to look forward to, and expand on our thinking about future versions.

Complete() API – Message received. Completes the receive operation on a message.
Abandon() API – Message deliver failed， put the message back to queue with delivery count increased
Defer() API – Indicates that the receiver wants to defer the processing of the message.

This article will analyze a scenario where messages are abandoned instead of completed when using the JMS approach of the Service Bus receiver.

Today, we remain just as committed to that goal—and are doubling down on our commitment to improving and growing the free tier alongside our premium offerings.
 
The free tier captures the world-class benefits of the App Service platform

Create your keys using the following command on your terminal


ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096 -C "test@mymail.com"



This will create a public key (.pub) and a private key.
Copy the public key on GitHub
Go to your GitHub account -> Settings -> SSH and GPG keys Click on New SSH key and copy the public key here.
Configure the Config Server on Azure Spring Apps
Go to the Azure Spring Apps Service -> Config ServerSpecify the GitHub URL, Label etc. and choose SSH as the Authentication protocol. Copy your private key in the text box and save.

(Optional) To ensure that the key works, you can test it on the local system as well.
Refer: Clone GitHub Repository using SSH


eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

ssh-add <private key>

git clone <GIT_URL>
#Example of the URL: git@github.com:username/testconfig.git

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you worked with R to explore a dataset and build a report from this analysis, you have probably heard about the tidyverse. If you used R in your data science project, to fit a predictive model able to produce the most accurate prediction possible for new data, you have probably experimented with tidymodels. However, questions like “what is the tidyverse” or “how does the tidymodels framework fit in it” might still have no clear answer for you.
 
What is the tidyverse
The simplest way to describe the tidyverse is as a collection of R packages - sharing common ideas and norms - designed to perform data science tasks easily and quickly.

Let us say you have been building your website for a while now and it is time to show the world what you have been working on. One of the best ways to achieve this is by hosting your site using Azure Static Web Aps (SWA). In this blog, I will take you step by step through deploying your site for the world to see. 
The first question in your mind might be, what is Static Web Apps? 
Static Web Apps is an Azure Service that you can use to build and deploy your web applications.

Connection from the 2012R2 on-prem Windows server to the AKS would fail, with the error message: 

 
Troubleshooting

Capture the network trace, and you will find Encrypted Alert during the TLS handshake:


2. Note that the handshake would fail immediately after the client hello. This means TLS handshake fails to establish, and most often it's due to the server and client does not have common cipher suites to exchange.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Function App under at least a Premium plan could have unlimited execution time. However, it might caused a duplicated invocation issue with a ServiceBus trigger because the "PeekLock" duration is up to 5 minutes (including renew).
 
It is a tutorial to reproduce such the scenario.
 
STEP 1: In Azure portal, create a new Premium python Function App and a Service Bus + Queue
 
STEP 2: Download the sample code and apply some changes.
https://cchlab.blob.core.windows.net/cchlab/cchlabsbf.zip
In "host.json", please specify the Function App timeout and the ServiceBus PeekLock timeout as below.

In "ServiceBusQueueTrigger1/function.json", please setup some configuration:
SBQ_STRING=<your service bus queue name>

Then, deploy the project to Function App.
 
STEP 3: Making an experiment with a short execution time.
Visit: https://<YourAppName>.azurewebsites.net/api/httptrigger1?t=<DurationInSecond>
Please specify the "DurationInSecond" to 30 this time, and you may see the result like this:

We apply this operation to send a message to the ServiceBus queue and told the ServiceBus trigger to pause 30 seconds before execution.
Now, please go to the monitor page:

You can see it is just a normal short invocation.
 
STEP 4: Making an experiment with a long execution time.
Visit: https://<YourAppName>.azurewebsites.net/api/httptrigger1?t=<DurationInSecond>
Please specify the "DurationInSecond" to 330 this time, and you may see the result like this:

Now, please go to the monitor page:

As you can see, there are duplicate invocations with the same message id, which might caused some potential business issues if we ignore them.
 
Conclusion:
Since we cannot adjust "maxAutoRenewDuration" to more than 5 minutes, we could only reduce the execution time from this ServiceBus trigger.]]></summary>

This is a chart that is mostly used in project management visually representing projection timelines for the project and the tasks. This is a tool that clearly outlines tasks and to which teams they have been assigned to. This helps you to manage the whole project in an efficient manner by taking note of the projection timeline. You get to keep everyone on the same page from product managers, program managers, business analyst, developers etc.
The main advantage of working with a Gantt Chart is that you get to plan, schedule, and execute your projects on just one chart. The other cool thing is you can track the progress by what has been completed, what is going on and upcoming tasks.

Today, as a result of both the evolution of technology and a change in behavior caused by the pandemic, online presentations, meetings and webinars have become increasingly common. Naturally, we should aim to make content that is understandable and accessible to our audience, so that the message that we are trying to convey can reach more people.
 
According to the World Health Organization, there are more than 1 billion people globally with some sort of disability. Furthermore, due to various circumstances, we often obtain situational disabilities – such as not being able to actively see slides when we are walking, or not being able to hear when attending in a noisy environment. Therefore, there are many different kinds of disabilities that we should accommodate to really mak…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About a year ago, we launched the Azure Monitor Agent (or AMA) as a powerful new agent from Azure Monitor and a simpler world of data collection. A lot of you adopted it already. Some witnessed a 50% cost reduction with the agent's filtering capabilities while others saw a reduction of 2000 person-hours using Data Collection Rules to centrally manage agent configuration. We also made a bunch of improvements (view past releases) in response to your growing needs around security, reliability, supporting new information, resource types, distros, operating systems, and network perimeters, to make the agent even more powerful and resilient. If you haven't already, adopt and migrate to AMA today to get all the benefits with more coming soon!

This doc will help you have a better understanding of the self-hosted portal architecture, and the binding behind the scene.
 
In some cases you might need functionality beyond the customization and styling options supported in the managed developer portal. If you need to implement custom logic, which isn't supported out-of-the-box, you can modify the portal's codebase, available on GitHub . For example, you could create a new widget to integrate with a third-party support system.
 
How to build and publish a self-hosted developer:

One of the obvious benefits of open, cloud-based technologies is the ability to integrate a wide range of global services with on-premises resources. If you’ve developed for financial services for any length of time, you know this openness adds another level of complexity to development. When money movement is involved, you’re going to encounter a higher level of risk and compliance considerations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overview:
The managed identities can be used both in the Azure Batch Account and Azure Batch Pool, which may cause confusion in some situations. This blog is aimed to help you understand the differences between the usage of the managed identity in the Azure Batch Account and in the Azure Batch Pool. The managed identity configured on the Batch account only grants permission for the Azure Batch Account to authenticate to other services but not for Azure Batch nodes (or Pool VMs).

Whilst today we have containers, serverless compute and many forms of persistence stores, today I will give you my thoughts on Storage (Object and Block) and VM (Virtual Machine) optimization.

Now that we are well acquainted with power apps and creating a microsoft graph custom connector in it, let us familiarize ourselves with the following terms once so that we can proceed to call Microsoft graph API in Power Automate using custome connectors for which we will require to set the criteria in authentication.
 
Azure API Management Gateway
Custom connectors are supported by Microsoft Azure API Management infrastructure. When a connection to the underlying API is created, the API Management gateway stores the API credentials or tokens, depending on the type of authentication used, on a per-connection basis in a token store. This solution enables authentication at the connection level.

To create a Microsoft Graph custom connector in Power Apps, let us get acquainted with some important terms first.
 
What are Power Apps?

Power Apps is a suite of apps, services, connectors, and a data platform, that provides a rapid development environment to build custom apps for business needs.
Using Power Apps, one can quickly build custom business apps that connect to data stored either in the underlying data platform (Microsoft Dataverse) or in various online and on-premises data sources (such as SharePoint, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, SQL Server).
One can create three types of apps using this service: canvas, model-driven, and portal.

GitHub classroom is great, and it lets educators create automatic grading solution with GitHub Actions. However, one of the pitfall is that students can easily change the unit test codes and GitHub actions workflow and educators cannot trust the automatic grading result. Another problem is that students must commit and push source code themselves. Educators therefore have no idea if students are copying from other or not. Also, educators don’t know how students develop their answer, and the details of every code change. 
Solution
To solve the potential cheating problem and to move from passive to active learning, we need a source of truth to run unit test and keep all changes of source codes when students are writing codes.
First, we create .vscode/settings.json to enable auto save…]]></summary>

Throughout this series we've been exploring many different aspects of using GraphQL in Azure, but it's always been from the perspective of creating a new API. While there are a certain class of problems which support you starting from scratch, it's not uncommon to have an existing API that you're bound to, and in that case, GraphQL might not be as easy to tackle.
Here's a scenario that I want to put forth, you've got an existing API, maybe it's REST, maybe it's a bespoke HTTP API, none the less you're building a new client in which you want to consume the endpoint as GraphQL. We could go down the path of creating an Apollo Server and using the RESTDataSource, or using HotChocolate's REST support, but for both of these…]]></summary>

What role does simplicity play when architecting solutions?
Simplicity is like a philosophy or a pervasive thread that you often have to revisit at every stage. From an architecture perspective you can visualize the way these solutions might fit together and then you ask yourself whether it's as simple as it needs to be or is it overly complex or can it be reduced further.  Ask yourself if you are providing too many knobs and bell…]]></summary>

Failure to do so can result in duplicate logins and registration errors that abruptly end user sessions. This undermines the quality of the test.

Why is it that we see sections where there is a dashed line and other sections where there is a solid line?

Meaning, this behavior is by design, yes, by design. It is useful for identifying missing data points. The line chart is a superior choice for visualizing trends of high-density metrics but may be difficult to interpret for the metrics with sparse values, especially when corelating values with time grain is important.

Low code development is using blocks instead of specific code to build apps and services. There are many Low Code platforms, Microsoft's is called Microsoft Power Platform.
The reason these platforms exist is that there's a great need to build business apps and not enough developers to build them. Also, many times non developer sit on business expertise, and it takes time to convey all they know to developers.

Introduction 
Computer vision is one of the core areas of artificial intelligence and can enable your solution to ‘see’ images and videos and make sense of them. Azure Computer Vision Service is a prebuilt computer vision solution that allows you to analyze images, recognize text and detect objects in images without writing a single line of code. 
What can you do with Vision Studio? 
Using the vision studio, you can test out different Computer Vision services including Face Identification, Image Tagging, Image Captioning, and many more. The UX is rich with pointers on Responsible AI …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background  
The Desired State Configuration (DSC) is a management platform that you can use to manage your IT and development infrastructure with configuration as code. The Azure Desired State Configuration (DSC) extension helps bootstrap a VM to the Azure Automation State Configuration (DSC) service. The DSC extension can be installed on Azure VMs as a Virtual Machine Extension.  The DSCForLinux extension installs the OMI and DSC agent on Azure virtual machines.  
  
Over the past year, our team has been developing Automatic Extension Upgrade which now supports the DSC extension. When Automatic Extension Upgrade for the DSC extension is enabled on a VM, the extension is upgraded automatically whenever Microsoft releases a new version for the extension. You can do this by simply setting the flag to true via API, CLI or PowerShell as documented here.  
   
Security Recommendations  
We strongly recommend enabling automatic updates for the DSC extension as soon as possible. This update ensures that customers get important security or performance updates to the extension as soon as possible without manual overhead.  
   
As always, we welcome feedback from customers and partners which supports our efforts to continuously harden our products and services. We want to thank the Wiz team for their collaboration and commitment to helping make Azure customers more secure.]]></summary>

We are thrilled to announce that applying configurations to virtual machines in Azure and Arc-enabled servers through Automanage machine configuration (formerly guest configuration) is now GA. This is an exciting milestone for both the Azure Governance community and the PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) community.
 
Machine configuration provides a native capability to audit or configure operating system settings as code, both for machines running in Azure and hybrid Azure Arc-enabled servers, directly per machine or at scale. Machine Configuration is integrated with Azure Automanage, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Azure Policy and will continue to expand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem statement:
Azure Cache for Redis has many uses, including data caching and session management. Many a times we see a sudden burst of traffic on our application, pushes our Azure Redis Cache under stress due to increased operations, active connections, memory usage etc. This causes cache's Server Load to spike, which adversely impacts application performance.
 
Server Load is the percentage of cycles in which the Redis server is busy processing and not waiting idle for messages. If this counter reaches 100, it means the Redis server has hit a performance ceiling and the CPU can't process work any faster. If you're seeing high Redis Server Load, then you see timeout exceptions in the client. In this case, you should consider scaling up or partitioning your data into multiple caches.

Understanding Static Web Apps config

Query success percentage measures the number of queries that return a non-Http5XX - for example, when a query completes successfully or fails with user-side errors. This number does not include queries initiated by Azure log search Alerts or Azure Sentinel. This signal will be available via Resource health in the near future.

Abstract
This article describes how to protect a complex application with multiple components (like CloudBees CI - Jenkins) on Azure Kubernetes Service against disasters like the complete loss of an Azure region with NetApp® Astra™ Control Service. We demonstrate how to protect a CloudBees deployment using multiple Jenkins instances with snapshots and backups and recover the entire application to a different Azure region in case of a disaster.

Read below for highlights and watch the video.
 
How is the architecture for mission critical apps different than for other apps?
We'd like there to be a consistent set of architectural principles for everything from the small to the large, but in general, when you're building mission critical applications, we need to think about things in terms of those uber important architectural patterns and system characteristics. When looking at mission critical apps it’s important to understand that there's going to be failure present within these applications at some component…]]></summary>

Cloud and cost. It can be quite a polarising topic. Do it right, and you can run super lean, drive down the cost to serve and ride the cloud innovation train. But inversely do it wrong, treat public cloud like a datacentre then your costs could be significantly larger than on-premises.In this multi-part blog series, I pass on my learnings (in a cloud agnostic way) and if you read(thank-you) and walk away with a meaningful cost-saving idea that you can actually execute in your environment, I’ll personally be exceptionally happy.

Multi-user authorization (MUA) for Azure Backup Recovery Services vaults can help you secure your backup data better by adding an additional layer of protection to critical operations on your Recovery Services vaults. A critical operation here can be described as an operation that could lead to loss of backup data, and hence, its misuse must be prevented.
 
Concepts
For MUA, Azure Backup uses an Azure resource called the Resource Guard to ensure critical operations are performed only with applicable authorization. Therefore, to perform a critical operation successfully, you must have sufficient permissions on the associated Resource Guard…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The first step is to create an Azure Service Principal account. You'll need the following:
 

An Azure subscription ID (find it here) or follow this guide.
A Service Principal with the following details the AppID, password, and tenant information. Create one with:
 az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "CICD" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID --sdk-auth
Replace "$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID" with the id from step 1.

Next, in your GitHub repository, add the output from the Service Principal (should be a JSON blob) as an Action Secret. You do this in your repository Settings.
 
Finally, create a GitHub workflow file by going to the "Actions" tab. Make sure you use the Azure login action:
 - uses: azure/login@v1   with:     creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
 
The full running example is in the sample GitHub repository which you can use to get started, or use the YouTube video for a detailed walk-through!

Microsoft and CAST partner together to automate migration and modernization of custom applications with Azure Migrate and CAST used together, under the Azure Migrate & Modernize Program.
 
In the past decade, organizations have been engaged in migrating their applications to clouds. Some of the in-house custom applications have been moved through simple “Lift & Shift” motions (Rehost) to quickly reach cloud and leverage some of its benefits, mostly at infrastructure level, example, in performance or resilience.

With the 0.2.0 release, there is now support for the build key.  The container image build is handled by Azure Container Registry, so you can either provide ACR credentials or a new container registry will be created for you as part of the creation process.  Only context and dockerfile are currently supported.  
 
Example Compose File for a .NET Web Api project:
 
 
 
 
version: '3'
services:
  api:
    build:
      context: ./src
      dockerfile: ./TodoApi/Dockerfile
    ports:
      - 8080:80
 
 
 
 
Example Repository Layout:
 

 
Example Command:
 
 
 
cd dotnet_api
az group create --name dotnet_api_example --location eastus
az containerapp compose create \
            --environment dotnetaca \

Log Analytics is a powerful tool to query your logs and gain insights from the abundance of data stored in them.
Sometimes, getting started with a query might be a challenge - especially for new users who are not yet familiar with our data structure and are not yet KQL fluent.
To assist users with their first steps in log exploration, we've introduced several tools, including built-in Example Queries and Query Packs, both designed to allow users to start their exploration with pre-built, curated queries.
Today we are happy to introduce another powerful way to start your log exploration - Find In Table.

At the end of every event or project, one of the key things you would want to receive is feedback. How was the event? Is there any part of the event that needs to be changed? If the feedback is given during the event, it is easy to respond and act on the feedback. However, most feedback is received after the event has happened. How do you gauge the different sentiments from the feedback and automate feedback response? In this session, we will create an end-to-end solution using Power Platform and Azure Cognitive Services to detect sentiments and respond to feedback proactively.

If you missed the session, here is what you need to catch up (Follow us on twitter to get notified of the upcoming activities):
Presentation content:

Microsoft University Recruiting in Africa
University Programs
Requirements for intern roles
Requirements for graduate roles
Application process
What University Recruiters are looking for
Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

Find the presentation deck here
These are some of the questions we received from the attendees, and below is the session recording with the recruiter’s responses and more:

What if you don’t have a degree but you have a diploma, do you have a chance for getting internship or full-time job?
A different recruiter once advised that you shouldn't have 'ratings' to the skills you have coz it may play against the applicant. Thoughts? 
Do self-taught developers stand a chance? 
What if your degree is not related to any tech-related course?

Note: This activity is a precursor to the Git & GitHub Technical workshop, where we will build websites to showcase our resumes. #GitHub.dev



Please let us know if you have any questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Azure AD B2C can be both fun and frustrating. You can customize a lot (which we love). But it's not always easy doing so (which we sometimes look upon less favorably). This post is not about how best to work the xml mojo with custom policies. What we will try to make smoother is the testability part.
 
Let me take a step back here and explain. The built-in policies are great as a user-friendly way for implementing simple authentication use cases. A couple of clicks in the Azure Portal to create a policy, test it in the Portal as well, and send off a couple of parameters to the dev team to inject in their code and that's it. In theory.
 
Unfortunately it doesn't always work out that way in practice. You need that extra little thing the user flows can't do so you need custom policies. You ne…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context
When you think of low code development, you think of inclusive technology as this introduces a visual approach (drag-drop) to developing software. Low code development empowers a citizen developer to quickly put together custom software solutions and increase focus on high-impact business operations. On the other hand, a code-first developer takes pride in writing code, working with source control - the traditional way of software development. But what happens when code-first developers need to contribute to the same project as citizen developers? Does this imply that either the code-first developers leave their area of comfort (dev environment) and fit into the citizen developer's world of low/no code and vice versa? Absolutely not!

"Show me what you can do by what you've done". This was the exact question one of my mentors asked me few years ago. I was so confident of my passion in data analysis, I had read and learnt a lot about the field but had no way to demonstrate my knowledge.
 
Let me summarize a 10-minute conversation with my mentor few years ago that led to a huge change in my career. It took me weeks to secure a 10-minute attention of my mentor to listen to my progress and all I have been able to do in the past few months. I approached my mentor with full confidence, spoke for 8 minutes on how much I knew about the evolving field of data analysis and science and that I believe I can start working in this field, his response was - "Show me what You can do by what You have done".
